Once upon a time,
in an obscure corner of the earth,
there was a teeny-tiny encounter.
And so began the long, long
adventure and days spent in combat
involving Son Goku and his friends,
and revolving around the Dragon Balls.
Battles against foes who
were mesmerized by Shen Long,
who would grant any wish...
Hit the mark!
A furious fight against Piccolo,
which ended in vengeance...
You lose!
The matchup against Vegeta,
with the survival of humanity at stake...
You dumb-ass!
The battle with Freeza on Planet Namek...
The Artificial Humans and the Cell Games...
See you in hell!
Now!
The final showdown with Majin Boo...
As one after another
powerful enemies appear,
the Super Saiyan Goku,
together with his growing sons,
Gohan and Goten, and his other friends,
save the earth from its tight spots,
and before anyone knows it,
peace returns to earth.
However...
Have you sensed it, too, Kaioshin?
Yes. He certainly is
awake early this time, isn't he?
My word, peace truly is short-lived.
And after they just created
the world anew, too.
I would think that Kaio
and the others sense it, too,
but tell him to be on the
lookout, just in case.
Mm-hmm. All right.
Yes, Kaioshin-sama.
Page 2/43
Yes, yes...
Yes, I have noticed it, too.
Hey! Be quiet, Goku! I'm
trying to talk here!
Goku? Do you mean, Son Goku-san is there?
Y-Yes.
He is here on my world to train.
We cannot allow him to
become aware of this.
He is sure to take an interest.
Yes, of course, where
Beers-sama is concerned...
G-Goodbye, then...
What about Beers-sama?
G-Goku!
Huh? Is that the name of some candy?
Y-You found me out, huh?
It is a most delicious candy.
Well of course it ain't!
Kaio-sama, you were talking
like you were pretty freaked out.
It's something you don't
need to know about.
Oh, if you tell me that,
I'm just gonna ask you even more!
There's no way I'm telling.
You were speaking to Kaioshin-sama, right?
Maybe I'll go ask him directly.
All right! All right! Don't go
using your Instantaneous Movement!
Don't tell Kaioshin-sama
that you heard this from me.
There are deities in this
world that create planets and life,
such as Kaioshin-sama.
And, conversely,
there are also deities
who destroy planets and life.
So then,
this Beers-sama is one of them?
That is correct. Beers the Destroyer.
Huh? He's a deity, but
he's still a destroyer?
Birth and destruction.
Page 3/43
They're needed in order to
maintain balance in the world.
I wonder how many worlds
will fall victim this time.
My goodness...
...Beers the Destroyer is awakening, is he?
We won't know peace for some time, huh?
Why have you changed into your gi?
This Beers-sama guy is
pretty strong, right?
Don't tell me you're...
I can't wait to see how strong he is!
Y-You idiot!
What?!
You just don't get it!
Beers-sama's strength
is on a completely different
level than you are!
He's Beers-sama, the
greatest destroyer in the world!
He's such a capricious
destroyer that even Kaioshin-sama
would be scared to come
face-to-face with him,
and maybe pee his pants
a little bit, he's so terrifying!
The part where he's the strongest
in the world has me fascinated!
Please wake up, Beers-sama.
You must not fall back asleep again.
You are the one who set your
alarm bomb yourself, aren't you?
If you don't get up soon,
your backup alarms will...
All right... all right.
I won't have you sleeping in
for 15 years, like you did last time.
If you insist on not getting up...
...would you like me to perform
my waking-up song for you again?
Well then...
A-All right!
All right.
I only slept 39 years this time.
Page 4/43
That's no more than a catnap.
Beers-sama, you are the
one who set your wake-up time.
Incidentally, why did you choose this time?
There's something that I was curious about.
Well, I have prepared your bath.
Please go take it.
No way. I hate baths.
You are covered in bomb soot.
It could contain mold.
Come on!
What if I say no?
Someone will say "Beers the Destroyer
is amazing, but pee-yew!"
and word will spread around.
Whis, I'm tired of your unfunny jokes.
I'll destroy you.
By the way, Whis, while I was asleep,
did Freeza leave Planet
Vegeta destroyed for me?
Yes, without a trace.
Oh, yeah? I could have given
the folks on that planet an eternity,
but they'd still be nothing but trouble.
And that King Vegeta was
especially hard-fisted.
I would have been happy
to destroy them, too,
but their world is so far away,
you know? It was too much trouble.
I have to admit, though,
Freeza is a bad apple, too.
He's so self-important.
The next time I see him,
I think I might destroy him, too.
There won't be any need for that.
Freeza has been defeated.
Eh?
You mean there's someone
that can defeat Freeza?
One moment, please.
Huh? It seems like I've
seen this somewhere before.
Who is this guy?
Page 5/43
A Saiyan.
He appears to be called
both Son Goku and Kakarrot.
I thought all the Saiyans died in
the destruction of Planet Vegeta.
Most of them did perish,
but some who happened to
be on other worlds were spared.
And by the way, Prince
Vegeta was one of them.
Isn't Saiyan hair supposed to be black?
I have to say, I'm surprised
a Saiyan could defeat Freeza.
At this point, the Saiyans
have acquired a technique
whereby they become
what they call "Super Saiyans."
What's that?
Super Saiyan? Super Saiyan?
Super Saiyan?!
That's it.
That's what it was!
What what was?
Let's see... Super Saiyan...
Super Saiyan...
n-God!
I dreamed about it!
A dream where I fought against
a Super Saiyan God, like this guy!
Uh-huh.
You still don't get it?
It was a premonition. Premonition!
You mean, your dream?
Beers-sama, your premonitions
don't have all that high
an accuracy rate, do they?
That dream you had earlier
about that idol moving here
didn't come true, did it?
You're making fun of me, huh?
All right, come with me, Whis.
Seer! Seer, are you here?
I was taking a walk. What is it?
You told me 39 years ago, didn't you,
Page 6/43
that in 39 years, an
arch-rival would appear?
Did I say that?
You said so, didn't you?
Okay, I did.
See?
The Seer's prophecy and my premonition...
An arch-rival of mine is going to appear.
A Super Saiyan God!
It sounds entirely questionable to me.
It's hard to imagine an arch-rival
for you to begin with, Beers-sama.
Well, even if the arch-rival that the
Seer mentioned is an exaggeration,
someone fascinating is
bound to appear, right?
That's why I woke up early this time.
I see. So that's why.
So, are you going to go see the Saiyans?
Of course I am.
I have to find this "Super Saiyan God."
Super Saiyan God, you say?
Such over-the-top naming.
It ends up sounding tawdry.
I found them. Most of
the surviving Saiyans,
five of them, are in 4032 Green, on Planet
877, living on a world called "earth."
Earth? I'm sure I've been
to that planet once, long ago.
That's the planet which
had something called dinosaurs,
which took a rude attitude toward me,
so I exterminated them, right?
However, one of them,
the Saiyan that defeated Freeza,
currently appears to be
on Kaio of the North's world.
A Saiyan at a Kaio's place?
That sounds suspicious.
Whis, how long will it take to get there?
Roughly 26 minutes.
About the length of an
episode of TV anime, huh?
Page 7/43
Sure is far!
Well, what choice is there?
I'll suck it up and go.
All right, then, let's be off!
To the Kaio of the North's world!
Yeah!
Bulma-san, happy...
...birthday!
Eh?! He's not coming?!
Why is he training at
Kaio-sama's place at a time like this?
That's the kind of guy he is.
Geez, I told him about
this over six months ago!
Huh? Where's Vegeta-san?
Looks like he's training.
Honest to goodness, you Saiyans...
He)', you there!
Eh?
Don't just sit around,
bring me another drink.
I'll give you an autograph afterward.
All right, what kind of
drink would you like?
Mister Satan, this gentleman
is Bulma-san's father, Dr. Briefs.
Th-The greatest genius in the world?
Not to mention the richest
man in the world.
Oh, sweetheart, you're
the richest man in the world?
Huh, I'm not too sure of that, myself.
H-How terribly rude of me!
By the way, what kind of
drink would you like?
D-Don't be absurd!
I will bring you something to drink!
What can I get for you?
Huh? I'm fine right now.
Oh, not at all! What
would you like to drink?
Okay, a cola.
A cola! Right, as you wish!
I will bring you a whole case, right now!
Page 8/43
Ah, geez, Papa. How embarrassing.
I put it on to look dashin' comin'
to Bulma-san's birthday party.
By the way, Bulma-san, just how
old have you turned this birthday?
How rude! As though I'd tell you!
It's true that the prizes
for the bingo tournament
include a castle and an airplane, right?
That's right. If that's too much
trouble, I can convert it to cash.
That's the richest person
in the world for you!
I wonder if Goku-sa will drop in
for at least the bingo tournament.
Bulma, are there any
X-rated DVDs among the prizes?
No!
O-Oh, no!
Wh-What is it, Goku?!
Today is Bulma's birthday party!
This ain't good! She'll be mad at me!
Oh. Don't startle me over
something like that!
She's scary. Probably...
It would be a close contest
between her and this Destroyer guy.
Kaio-sama?
Goku!
Th-This is serious! Here! Right here!
Huh?! Bulma is coming here?!
No!
Beers-sama is!
Beers the Destroyer is on his way here!
Huh? Eh?
I ain't sensing anything.
You can't sense the presence of deities!
Remember, whatever you do,
refrain from doing anything stupid.
It will be fine, I tell you.
All right!
You worry me.
Goku, go hide inside the house!
Huh? What for?
Page 9/43
Quickly!
And quickly, too. Geez...
Hurry!
Okay, O kaY!
Why, though? Why is Beers-sama coming here?
Why, indeed?
Wh-Why, Beers-sama...
Him, huh?
He sure looks like he
ain't just anyone, all right?
...w-welcome to my...
...humble place. Thank you
for coming... all this way...
Long time no see, huh?
Kaio of the North...
Huh? Oh! That guy's the
one they call Beers-sama?
I must say... your world...
...is small, huh?
Eh? Y-Yes... I'm terribly sorry.
Please excuse the cramped fit.
Long ago, Beers-sama
destroyed it, making it smaller...
taking it out after
losing at hide-and-seek.
Oh, did I?
However, considering that
you restored your world earlier,
and you did not bring
it back to its original size,
you must prefer it to be
this size, don't you?
Anyhow...
Beers-sama, what brings you here?
Ah, I have a little business
with the Saiyan inside.
Yikes!
Come on out here!
H-How terribly impolite of me!
Goku! Come say hello to Beers-sama!
Heya! I'm Go...
I was certain you were going to say that!
You're old enough to know better!
At least offer a proper greeting!
Page 10/43
Uh, wh-why, hello there. I'm... I mean...
My name is Son Goku.
It's honorable to meet you, Sir.
Good morning. Now then,
I have something I want to ask you.
Let's see... Super...
Super Saiyan God.
Yes, yes.
Do you know of the existence
of this "Super Saiyan God"?
Super Saiyan God?
I know of just plain "Super Saiyans,"
but I ain't ever heard
of that "God" business.
I haven't heard of it, Sir.
This is the first time I have heard
the term "Super Saiyan God," myself.
Ah, I see.
I heard from Whis, here, that
you're the one who defeated Freeza?
Freeza? Yeah, I defeated
him, all right. Sir.
It doesn't appear to me like
you could defeat him as you are,
but I understand you
transform and power up...
into what's called a Super Saiyan.
That is correct. You are well informed.
But you don't know about the God thing.
Whis...
...is Prince Vegeta, on the planet
called earth, also a Super Saiyan?
Yes. And each of the three others
also seem to be able to transform.
You know that much, as well?
All of them, huh?
That seems suspicious. Well then...
I wonder if I can find
anything by going to earth.
B-Beers-sama, I do not think
the other Saiyans know, either.
I won't know unless I ask them, will I?
Whis, how long to reach earth?
Roughly three minutes.
Page 11/43
Three minutes? All right, then. Well, I
think I'm going to go see this "earth."
Um...
You're not going to destroy it,
or anything, right?
As long as nothing happens to annoy me.
Hey, listen!
Ain't you... I mean, Beers-sama,
I heard you were ridiculously strong.
Would you mind showing
me just a little of it? Sir?
You want to see my power? How?
I'd like to have a sparring
match with you, if only for a minute!
Goku! That's enough!
I have lived a long time,
but I've never heard a
request as unique as that one.
You certainly seem sure of yourself.
Or could it be that you're simply
just a big dummy, instead?
Yes, he's a big dummy!
He is just a big dummy, you see!
Sure.
Okay, come at me with your full power.
Thank you! I mean, thank you very much!
But are you sure you want my
full power right from the start?
If you get hurt, don't go getting
upset and destroying this planet.
You have my promise.
Well, go ahead.
Okay -
First, this is "Super Saiyan."
And this is "Super Saiyan 2."
And this is the mighty "Super Saiyan 3"!
Run for it, Bubbles!
Well, well, this is a surprise.
It appears that this isn't
just a bunch of hot air, after all.
Heh-heh, you see?
If you want, I can go back to "2" for you.
No, no, as you are will be fine.
Okay, begin.
Page 12/43
You're looking down on me. All right...!
Well then, let's be off.
Okay -
See you later, Kaio of the North.
Are you still alive, you big dummy?
Oh, right! I can't just sit around.
I have to contact Vegeta
as soon as possible!
Vegeta! It's Kaio!
What do you want with me, Kaio?
Listen closely to what I'm about to say.
Beers the Destroyer will
be there very soon.
The Destroyer?
I've heard that name before.
In any case, once Beers-sama arrives there,
do absolutely, absolutely
nothing to engage him!
Otherwise, it will mean the
annihilation of the earth itself.
The earth will be annihilated?
Goku couldn't leave well
enough alone, and was easily beaten.
He was what?! Kakarrot?!
Super Saiyan 3 Goku was left
barely breathing after just two blows.
Just two blows, you say?
I'm begging you.
The fate of the earth rests with you.
That really was awesome.
Imagine, there being someone like that...
I warned you, over and over!
Just be grateful you weren't killed!
To get any stronger,
there ain't no choice but to
merge with Vegeta, is there? No...
...even at that, I doubt I could beat him.
Let's hope the people on
earth don't do anything foolish.
He said something about
"Super Saiyan God," didn't he?
Is that something I can
arrive at with training?
Or is it the name of a Saiyan
Page 13/43
called "God"? Is there another...?
A senzu bean?
I'm better!
Kaio-sama, we have to
let everyone on earth know!
I've already told Vegeta.
He's the one most likely
to step over the line, after all.
Things ain't looking good.
I'd better get back to earth right away.
Or maybe I should train a bit first.
You're finally here, huh, Vegeta?
Oh, and why are you
wearing your combat gear
to your own wife's birthday party?
What's wrong? You seem unusually blue.
A-ha, could it be that you're in shock over
your beloved wife turning another year older?
It sure is nice for you Saiyans,
not having to grow older.
Silence!
What do you mean, "silence"?! Hmph!
What is this? I've got
a knot in my stomach.
Is the great Vegeta-sama
trembling with fear?
What is with you?
Beers the Destroyer...
Without a doubt, I know
I've met him somewhere before...
Hey, Prince Vegeta, right?
You're all grown up now, aren't you?
It looks like this "Ki" that you
all use doesn't work on deities.
Ah, yes, well...
Something's come over Vegeta.
Do you remember me now?
I remember!
When we previously met,
you were still just a little boy, huh?
Don't you remember? Your
father, King Vegeta,
put on quite a spread for me.
The Destroyer, Beers...
Page 14/43
...-sama...
What Kaio said was no exaggeration.
This guy is trouble.
He's way beyond trouble!
It looks to me like you're up
to something enjoyable here.
What's more, I smell something very good.
A-Ah, this? My wife is
having a birthday party.
Your wife? Well, I'll have
to go pay my respects.
Beers-sama...
Oh, right. The point of my visit...
Have you ever heard the
term "Super Saiyan God"?
Super Saiyan God?
You don't know it, then?
Are you sure your premonition wasn't wrong?
I'm never wrong!
But you are, quite often.
I'm starting to get annoyed.
Oh, Vegeta, the man who
tells his wife to be silent...
Who have we here?
O-Oh, th-this is...
...Beers-san and...
The name is Whis.
Oh, friends of yours?
Hello. I'm Bulma, Vegeta's...
...beautiful wife.
...Hello, Bulma-san.
...Hello, Bulma-san.
Oh, my! For being friends of yours,
they have fine manners.
But you don't appear to be from earth.
You're aliens, right? Aliens?
Th-That's enough!
We just happened to drop by earth,
and spotted Vegeta-kun here.
Sightseeing? If you'd like,
why not come party with us, first?
You're quite welcome.
H-Hey!
Well, I do hate to intrude...
Page 15/43
...but the truth is, I spotted some of the most
delicious-looking food when I first got here.
Go ahead, go ahead.
C-Come, let's go down there.
Hey! You there, the cat monster!
How'd you like a match with me?
A match?
Th-That idiot!
I'm pretty good!
Oh, Dad, you're embarrassing us!
I apologize for his rudeness.
Where are the Dragon Balls?!
You idiots! If you make any
loud noises, they'll hear us!
R-Right!
All right...
This house is ridiculously huge,
for crying out loud!
Pesky fools!
We' re sorry.
Sheesh!
Just where are the Dragon Balls, anyway?
All seven of them are
supposed to be together here.
I don't know why I can't
get my wish granted,
but right now, we're in luck!
My next goal is to be hugely wealthy!
Huh?
L-it's not world domination?
Getting a great deal of money comes first.
I've had enough of living the poor life.
We couldn't even get
hired for part-time work
in these child-like
bodies we have, you know!
...Y-Yes...
...Well...
I am Great King Pilaf!
Earlier, when we were
finally about to get Shen Long
to grant our wish, Pilaf-sama,
you said "Make us young again!"
Y-Yeah, but...
Page 16/43
...there's no point in dominating
the world when we're old,
if we're going to drop dead right away.
Maybe so, but we're too young like this!
It was a relief for me.
My life has been greatly
extended, in dog years.
Stop your griping and hurry up
and find the Dragon Balls!
And if worse comes to worst,
let's just grab anything of value!
...Yes, Sir!
...Yes, Sir!
Okay!
"Prizes"
O-Over here...
What is it?
"Bingo Tournament Prizes-Keep Out!"
You don't suppose...
...all of these...
...are prizes?!
That castle is a prize!
...Wow!
...Damn it, what a ritzy bunch!
I'll spray graffiti on them!
"Stupid"
Take that! And that! And that!
I.
That's quite sordid.
...Come on!
...Let's hurry!
Yeah! The Dragon Balls must be
hidden here someplace! Find them!
...Yes, sir!
...Yes, sir!
You don't think they're
inside the castle, do you?
Pilaf-sama!
Did you find them?!
The participation prize is a
ten-year assortment of fine hams!
Get two or three boxes!
Yahoo!
The second-place prize is...
Page 17/43
What a ridiculously huge diamond!
Be sure to take it!
But if this is the second-place prize...
First-place must be...
We sure found them easily enough.
Pilaf-sama!
Th-There really are all seven of them here!
...Yahoo! Yahoo!
...Banzai! Banzai!
Pilaf-sama, let's get our
wish granted right now!
You fool!
If we summon Shen Long in here,
the ceiling will collapse on us!
Hey, you guys!
What are you doing in there?
W-We're friends of the boy who lives here.
Huh? My friends?
Y-You're the boy who lives here?!
That monkey is talking!
...Mon...
...Mon...
Who are you calling a monkey?!
I am Great King Pilaf!
We came here to burgle the place!
What's the big idea, giving
them your real name?
Hey, Goten! Come over here and
see this! There's a funny monkey!
I'm not a monkey!
Hmm?
Hey, boy! Be quiet! Do
you want to get hurt?!
What?
Look.
Th-That distinctive hairstyle...
It looks extremely familiar...
Those blank eyes that
reveal such innocence!
They look extremely familiar...
H-He's that...
"Genuine great ape!
Clear out!
Right!
Page 18/43
You can have this.
Pilaf-sama! Wait for me!
Wow, that really was one
strange monkey and dog, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, who was that girl who gave
you the pretty rock as a present?
Is she your friend, Trunks-kun?
She's... my girlfriend.
What do you think? Amazing, huh?
You mean, you're going out with her?
W-Well, yeah. We've even held hands.
That's amazing!
Y-Yeah, I guess.
Amazing.
Damn! What is he doing here?!
He's still a child, too!
And thanks to him, we didn't
get the Dragon Balls, did we?!
What?! You're creeping me out!
Prepare to feast your eyes... on this!
I used the diamond to distract their gaze.
They haven't realized that the
Si Xing Qiu ball has been stolen.
You've outdone yourself, Mai!
Yes!
Just a minute! We can't grant
our wish with just one of them.
Don't you worry about that, Pilaf-sama.
We'll say, "if you want this back,
hand over one million zeni,"
and demand their money!
Oh, I get it!
Mai, you're a genius! You big-time rascal!
Oh, no, not as much as you are, Pilaf-sama.
But that diamond was worth
more than ten billion zeni, wasn't it?
U-Um...
Y-You idiot! That huge
amount of money just means
that much more stress, doesn't it?
Y-Yeah! If we get so
nervous that we pee our pants,
are you offering to wash them for us?!
Page 19/43
Huh?
Eh?
Ahem...
I'm not so sure about that example.
It seemed to be a little bit off-color.
I beg your pardon.
Hmm? Isn't that...?!
It's him! What is he saying?!
That girl over there is
your girlfriend, Trunks?
I don't know who you take after,
but you're quite the stud,
aren't you? Nice going!
Amazing, huh?
Y-Yeah, I guess.
Call her over here for me.
Yo'.!
My good lad! You just flew
through the air to get here!
Never mind about that, I...
...was trying to act cool, and
said that you were my girlfriend.
You said I was...?
N you'.!
Then, me?
Why would I?! This girl here!
Who, me?! Me, with a
little boy like you...?
You're a little girl, yourself, aren't you?
Oh, right.
I hate to ask, but pretend
to be my girlfriend for a while.
P-Pretend to be your girlfriend?
What do I have to do?
Well, we hold hands... and stuff...
H-Hands?!
The children these days are so depraved!
You're free to eat all
the food you want, too.
Food?!
And there's a bingo tournament, too!
Absolutely!
Come on!
Just a moment.
Page 20/43
Pilaf-sama, I know he is a child,
but holding hands with a boy
on the very same day
I met him is something I can't...
You're actually more than
old enough for this, aren't you?
Pilaf-sama, there are some things
you can say, and some you can't!
Do it, Mai! For the food and
the bingo tournament! As well as...
...the Dragon Balls it comes with.
I've seen that older
lady somewhere before...
I-it was back then!
Yes, that is her, all right!
That kid earlier and the one
who was with them back then...
I'm getting nothing but
bad feelings about this!
Come on, let's go.
R-Right!
These "takoyaki" balls are fascinating.
They are quite delicious.
Both the sauce flavor and
soy sauce flavors are fantastic.
So your name is Mai-chan?
Mai-chan, how old are you?
You shouldn't tease the grown-ups!
Ka...
...ha...
Please don't wreck anything else.
Hal!
This is crazy!
It's no use. I can't beat
the Destroyer like this.
Beers-sama was much, much stronger.
Hey, Kaio-sama!
It looks like a quick bit of
training ain't gonna be enough
to reach this Super Saiyan God thing.
I have to admit, I'm not seeing
any sign of this Super Saiyan God.
I was kind of looking forward to it.
From what I hear, as far as the Saiyans go,
Page 21/43
aside from Son Goku and Vegeta,
the others are all half-earthling.
And two of them are still just children.
Okay, next up is everyone's
favorite, the bingo tournament!
While the castle and the
airplane are both terrific prizes,
the main attraction has to be...
Look at this! All seven
Dragon Balls together!
If you win, you can have
whatever wish you want granted!
Oh? Those balls are a lot like
Planet Namek's wish orbs, huh?
...Earth's Kami does appear to be a
Namekian, after all... All right!
As I recall, a dragon
appears from the wish orbs,
and grants any wish they want, right?
H-Hey, just a minute!
Aren't you one Dragon Ball short?
The Si Xing Qiu ball is gone!
No way! They were all
there a little while ago!
Hey, are you leaving already?
Mai-chan, tell me what
your cell phone number is!
I don't have anything so fancy!
Hold on!
You idiot!
O-Oh, no, I fell into their trap.
You're the one who cried out, you know.
At this point, there's little choice left.
Damn it!
P-Pilaf-sama!
H-Hey, all of you! If you
don't want this kid to get killed,
you'll hand over one million zeni!
Well, 100,000 zeni will be okay, too.
Wh-What's so funny? I really will kill him!
That child says she will kill him,
yet the others are laughing.
Maybe they need some punishment.
N-No! That girl is apparently
Page 22/43
my son's girlfriend, after all!
This is just a silly game.
I really, really, really mean it!
U-Um, Mai-chan...
No talking, hostage!
Your chest is touching me.
Oh, this is an entertaining
side show, isn't it?
All right, I'll play along!
You adorable little villains!
The Great Saiyaman does
not stand for bad guys!
...Yeah! Yeah!
...Way to go!
Seems fishy. By any chance,
is that the Super Saiyan God?
P-Please, do not get the wrong idea!
That is just Kakarrot's son,
dressed up in a disguise!
Young lady, go ahead and try to shoot me!
Th-That's crazy!
S-Stay back!
It really is okay for you to shoot me.
I think that will liven
things up a bit more.
I know! While you're at it,
shoot all your bullets at once at me!
Mm-hmm, that will be great!
A-All of them?
It's no problem.
He can deflect all of them away.
But don't shoot at my feet or anything.
Let's keep it simple.
Aim right for the face, okay?
Okay, villains! Shoot as much as you like!
Okay, but you asked for it!
How do you like that, you villains?!
Do you now realize the
power of the Great Saiyaman?!
That's not like him. He's not
accustomed to drinking so much.
You guys, I thought that was just a toy,
but it's a real gun, isn't it?
You children shouldn't be
Page 23/43
carrying something like that.
If it hadn't been me, this
could have been really serious.
Ee-yow!
Videl! Videl, are you okay?
Videl-san!
Gohan! What's the big idea,
hittin' your own wife?
L-I'm so sorry!
Here, let me have a look.
Can you heal her, Turtle Hermit-san?
I'll give her mouth-to-mouth...
That has nothing to do with an injured leg!
You haven't changed at
all, you dirty old man!
N-Neither have you! How could
you do that to a great sage?!
Allow me to heal her.
Wh-What do you think you're doing?
You should watch what you say.
This person is Kami-sama.
K-Kami-sama? You don't mean, for real?
Are you really Kami-sama?
It's better.
Thank you very much, Kami-sama.
Um, your tummy is carrying...
Shh! It's still a secret.
Oh, it is?
Gohan, no more drinkin'
alcohol for you for a while! Got it?!
Y-Yes. Thank you, Dende...
I mean, Kami-sama.
This is a dream, right? A dream.
But I thought we were
dreaming before, and it was all real.
By any chance, can you
deflect bullets, too?
Of course I can. You knew that
when you started the act, right?
And you there, the dog,
you can't just stand there in a daze.
You have to hurry up and
come slashing at me!
S-Sorry.
Page 24/43
And monkey, your intensity
leaves a lot to be desired!
What a shame. It could
have gone over better.
We'll try harder next time.
Wh-What did you think?
That was an entertaining show, right?
One of them came flying at me, too.
It feels a bit itchy.
Unpleasant. Very unpleasant.
So then, will you destroy the earth?
It might be best to renew
the whole planet at once.
Before Creation cometh Destruction.
Hey, come on, you guys!
That's all for the side show!
Now, let the fun of the
bingo tournament begin!
P Bingo! P
P Bingo! P
P Bingo! P
What's come over Vegeta?
P Fun time bingo! P
P Earth is a fun place to be! P
P The food 'vs good there, too'. P
P Fun time bingo! P
P Fun time bingo! Yeah! P
That was somewhat engaging, huh?
Yeah. I never figured him to
be such a poor singer and dancer.
He could give your songs
a run for their money, Whis.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, let's collect ourselves
by getting some more food.
Yeah, all right.
Okay, that was good.
All right, children, that Ball isn't a toy.
You can't go carrying it
around without asking first.
But your little skit was
kind of entertaining. Thank you.
Okay, the Dragon Balls
are all back together,
Page 25/43
so let's start playing bingo!
I sacrificed my pride to preserve
Beers' mood, so things managed to work out.
But it shouldn't be an issue anymore.
All that's left now is to get him to leave
earth while he's still in a good mood.
Is anyone one spot away from bingo yet?
Beers-sama...
Have you tried that
dessert they call "pudding" yet?
It truly is velvety-smooth and delicious.
What's that? Pudding, you say?
Where exactly is it?
Over there.
Oh my, it was here just a moment ago.
Don't tell me you ate them all, Whis.
Indeed not!
You there, is there any more pudding?
L-I'm sorry, but the pudding
over there is the last of it.
You there... Would you mind
sharing one of those with me?
Make that two... one for me.
If not, at least let us have one, for me.
Beers-sama, that's not fair.
You've already had one, right?
Hand it over.
Boo! No way!
What?!
I'm eating them all myself!
But there are so many of them!
All of them are mine!
Give me one!
No!
Give me one!
No!
Give me one, you dummy!
You called me a dummy.
I'm gonna turn you to candy and eat'cha!
Oh, no! I look away for one second, and...!
Now I'm completely upset!
Hey!
What did you do that for?!
Beers-sama! Please stop!
Page 26/43
S-Stop him!
Ten-san'.!
He's out of this world!
Kuririn-san, get the others out of here!
Y-Yeah...
Are you all right?
Goten! Get her two friends!
Uh-huh!
You wouldn't give me any pudding,
so I'm gonna hurt you some more.
Stop!
Damn it! It doesn't matter anymore!
This way, Beers!
Thanks for waiting.
Ho! This tastes absolutely delicious!
What do you call this food?
Huh? O-Oh, it's called sushi.
Oh, yum.
He beat Vegeta in the blink of an eye!
Mai, wait here a minute.
Goten!
I know!
Fu...
...$ion! Ha!
Yay!
G-Goten has gone and
turned delinquent again!
His fighting senses, at
least, are pretty good.
Hey, you! The cat-person!
Cause a big ruckus over pudding, will you?!
Anyone who has manners that
bad gets their butt kicked by Gotenks!
What did you say?
You earthlings are probably
accustomed to eating it,
but for me, it's an unknown food,
whose flavor I can't even guess!
Pudding! Even the naming
makes it sound delicious, doesn't it?!
Y-You hush!
Don't! You're no match for him!
Ow! Ow!
I'm sorry'.
Page 27/43
I imagined that you'd be beyond the pale,
but I never thought our
levels would be this far removed.
Damn, the end is finally here.
You run out of pudding,
and the Super Saiyan God isn't here.
I guess it's time for destruction.
Hmph, it might be an honor to be
eliminated by Beers the Destroyer.
Oh, well isn't that a nice thing to say?
All right then, as you wish...
Hey, that's enough of that already!
I don't care if you're a
friend of Vegeta's or not,
but you've turned my 38th
birthday upside-down, you know!
38th, is it?
H-How dare you... hit my... Bulma!!
You filthy bastard!
This is incredible!
I think Vegeta has finally
surpassed Goku, hasn't he?
Take this!
Wh-What's that?
Are they launching off extra-large
fireworks at the Capsule Corporation again?
Well?
Sure enough, that doesn't seem
to be Super Saiyan God, either.
Enough, already. I'm going to
destroy the earth and head back.
Whis!
Just a moment!
So it's a sea urchin battleship roll?
This is quite delicious, too.
L-I won't let you do it!
You're always "destroy
this," "destroy that"!
Let it go. I told you, it's already over.
Vegeta!
Vegeta!
Whis, I say!
You called, Beers-sama?
It looks like this Super Saiyan
Page 28/43
God is just a pointless dream,
like you said it was.
And I'll say it again! I'm gonna
destroy the earth and head back!
As you wish. But could you
please wait a little while longer?
H-How is the tuna roll?
Fantastic!
Incidentally, I don't seem
to have very much time.
Could you wrap some of this up to go?
Um, the earth is, I suppose,
enjoyable in some aspects,
so I will give you one last chance.
You, over there!
Yes, you there! You!
M-Me?
Yes. You, the tasty-looking one.
H-He's gonna eat me!
Come over here.
L-I'm yucky! I taste incredibly yucky!
Rock-paper-scissors with me,
and if you win, I will leave.
But if I win, I will destroy the earth.
R-Rock-paper-scissors?
Destroy the earth?
No way! I'm lousy at rock-paper-scissors!
The fate of the earth has
been entrusted to you!
This is your first big role, isn't it?
If you lose, you're to blame.
P-Pu-erh, I'll get you!
Ah! So that's it! Hey, I get it!
I know why you're the
one he picked, Oolong!
He thinks that you're just an ordinary pig!
And as a pig, he thinks
you can only throw scissors!
However, you're a pig-man!
He doesn't realize you can
also throw rock and paper!
He's sure to throw rock,
so Oolong, if you throw paper, you'll win!
L-I get it! A-All right! L-Let's do this!
Page 29/43
Are you ready yet?
Y-Yeah!
All right...
...Rock-paper-scissors!
...Rock-paper-scissors!
Fools! I heard your whole strategy.
Wait!
Goku!
Goku-sa!
Goku!
Son-kun'.!
You, again? What do you want?
Did you get a handle on
what this "God" thing is?
That's still a mystery,
but don't destroy this planet.
I am a god of destruction.
I know that, Beers-sama.
But just this once, give us a pass.
And do what? Are you
going to fight me again?
I'd like to say I will,
but you've got me in a bind.
To be honest, no matter what I do,
I ain't gonna be able to beat...
That's it!
Beers-sama, is it okay if
I try my luck at something?
For what?
You know, that Super Saiyan God thing.
There just might be a
chance of getting one!
How so?
Would you give me just a little
bit of time? Just a little? Okay?
Please!
Very well. But just a little.
Thank you!
Bulma! I'm gonna have to
use the Dragon Balls!
That's fine. If it's going to put
that dumb rude jerk in his place,
then use them all you want!
That's a spiteful thing to say.
Page 30/43
The man is a deity!
Huh? A deity?
Yeah.
So? If you're a deity,
then don't go pitching fits
over something like pudding, you dummy!
He's no ordinary deity.
He's a god of destruction,
the most terrible kind in the world.
His name is Beers-sama.
He's the strongest guy in the universe.
Strong enough that he scares the
crap out of Kaio-sama and Kaioshin-sama.
Everyone, please mind
your manner of speech.
If you happen to offend Beers-sama,
you will be destroyed, along
with the entire solar system.
B-Beers-sama!
S-Stop that! It has the opposite
effect with middle-aged women!
Shut up!
OW!
Goku, what are you going
to do with the Dragon Balls?!
Come forth, Shen Long!
And grant me my wish!
So that's it! You're thinking
of having Shen Long
put a stop to the destruction of the earth!
Nope.
That would be too much for him.
The Capsule Corporation, huh?
Rich people have the
wildest attractions, huh?
I shall grant thee any wish. Now, speak!
Listen, Shen Long...
Um... do you know what
a Super Saiyan God is?
Huh? What's that?
Ho, that's the same
question that I was going to ask.
Yeah, I do know.
Huh? You know it? Really?
Page 31/43
Really. Ls your wish
whether or not I really know?
No. No, no, no, no.
If you know, then could
you bring one here for us?
I cannot bring one, for one does not exist.
Super Saiyan God is a deity
that can only be formed
by Saiyans temporarily.
What do you mean by that?
You are asking many questions.
What exactly is your wish?
Beers-sama says to produce
a Super Saiyan God.
Hm? Ah, B-Beers-sama?!
Why, it is Beers-sama! Pleased to meet you!
Tell them how to form a Super Saiyan God.
Er, right!
I've never seen Shen Long like this.
A Super Saiyan God is a savior,
created by chance by a
handful of righteous Saiyans,
who long ago questioned the
evil acts of their fellow Saiyans,
and led a revolt against them.
This savior had immense power,
and dispatched the evil
Saiyans in no time at all,
but shortly thereafter,
they returned to normal,
with their power apparently used up.
Once again, Planet Vegeta
became a world of evil Saiyans,
and the savior was also
eliminated from their legends.
This vanished legend goes...
This story sure is long, huh?
Are you getting this, Vegeta?
Shh! Keep quiet!
..."Five Saiyans who possess
righteous hearts join hands,
and by instilling light into
another righteous Saiyan,
they will become a Saiyan god."
Page 32/43
I have now told you the method. Farewell.
Please excuse me.
Five Saiyans who possess righteous hearts?
Hmph, that's impossible.
The only two Saiyans like
that are Gohan and Goten.
How rude of you! While we may
not be able to say much about Vegeta,
Trunks has a righteous heart, doesn't he?
Ha! Any kid his age that
already has a girlfriend is impure.
My, you sound like an old fogey!
Are you sure you're not just jealous?
Yeah, Piccolo-san! Are you
sayin' Goku-sa is impure, too?
Hmm, it's true that Goku may be pure,
but he's purely a fool for fighting.
Whether that counts as a
pure heart is a subtle distinction.
Shut your mouth, you dirty old geezer!
Wh-What did you call me?!
Such a thing to call a sage!
Hurry up and give rise
to a Super Saiyan God!
Um, broadly speaking,
don't all five of the Saiyans here
possess hearts that are righteous?
Hmm? Even Vegeta?
Don't you judge me!
Vegeta-san may have been
evil a long time ago,
but I'm not so sure about now. Is he evil?
Now that you mention it, you're right.
He hasn't done anything
bad for a good while now.
Stop insulting me!
You're saying the great
Vegeta-sama has a righteous heart?!
It doesn't matter,
just hurry up and give it a try!
Why does Kakarrot get to be the main one?
Quit complaining!
Father, h-has there been any change?
W-Well, I ain't sure.
Page 33/43
There, thanks for waiting.
These are called tempura prawns, are they?
That's good, too.
Oh, they did m.
Well, Kakarrot?
Father, you have an
outstanding battle power.
Goku has finally gone and become a god!
Son-kun! Go ahead and show him!
Don't bother, Goku!
It won't do any good to fight him.
That was not godly.
B-But...
The reason your battle power went up
is due to nothing more than
collecting energy from the others.
He's correct in saying so.
If all you have is battle power
that appears superficially,
you can't call it godly.
Ah, that makes sense.
Yeah, you're right. I don't feel
like I could beat you, Beers-sama.
Oh, no...
Listen closely, everyone.
Please remember what he said.
The light from five of you
is instilled into one other.
The total number of Saiyans
you need is six, is it not?
Oh, so that's it! We goofed up!
Six? Then, one other... one other...
That's it!
Vegeta, you've got an on-the-level
younger brother, don't you?
On a faraway planet. What's worse,
I don't even know where it is.
You didn't even get his cell phone number?
Enough! I was looking forward
to an interesting development,
but you've disappointed me.
I'm starting to get drowsy,
so I'll destroy the earth
right now, and head home.
Page 34/43
E-Excuse me! There is one other!
Videl-san? What other one?
Um, not quite another one,
but soon to be another one, you might say.
But it definitely has Saiyan blood.
What are you talking about, Videl?
Your papa may be a great man,
but I'm a full-blooded earthling!
I'm not talking about you, Papa!
Um, Videl-san has a baby inside her tummy.
D-Do you mean it?!
I do.
I didn't say anything, because
I wanted to surprise you, Gohan-kun.
Hooray!
...Wow!
...Congratulations!
Are you turning God, or not?
C-Come on, let's add
Videl-san, and try it again!
Mm-hmm!
Will this even work?
It hasn't even been born yet.
We've got nothing to
lose, so let's just try it!
Right.
Maybe it's not going to work after all...
Hey, that's the same
old Goku as always, right?
But look at him. His hair is red!
You're right. He also looks a bit thinner.
I can't tell what Goku's battle power is.
Congratulations.
It appears they were successful.
It was worth waiting so very patiently.
Really? Have I become a Super Saiyan God?
We should know once we start fighting.
Now, come and fight me.
All right! Well, here I come!
Sure. If you're the stronger one,
I won't destroy the earth for you.
Huh? You mean it? Thanks so much!
Okay, everyone, this will be dangerous,
so please give them a little more room.
Page 35/43
Well? What are your
impressions on being a god?
I'm stunned.
I see. You're surprised.
That's the same impression I had.
Good. Keep that up.
What's wrong? You seem dissatisfied.
A little.
You don't care to be a god?
Nope. I never knew there
was a world like this.
What do you mean?
A world that I couldn't come to by myself.
And you're unhappy with that?
Yeah. I ain't happy!
Hmm? What's that?
An earthquake?
You say such interesting things.
You don't like working with
your friends to become a god?!
Oh, I'm happy. I'm happy,
but without using everyone else's power,
I couldn't fight with
you like this, Beers-sama!
That frustrates me!
Then why did you turn God?
Because I wanted to fight you, Beers-sama.
You really are a fool for fighting, huh?
I get that a lot.
Let's follow them!
Right!
Here we go!
They're ramping it up!
Excuse me.
I beg your pardon.
What is this mysterious, delicious item?
Huh? Oh, it's ice cream.
Ice cream? How novel!
Imagine, making food this cold!
Exactly how does one make it?
L-I don't know.
Oh, my. A reply as cold as this ice cream.
Well? That was a pretty
good one, wasn't it?
Page 36/43
It looks like they're having
a pretty wicked fight, huh?
Th-That bastard! He always snaps up
the best of things for himself!
But still...
Wh-What?
I'm glad that's not me.
Huh?
Are you still unhappy with being a god?
A bit!
That pride will prove to be a weakness!
Good-for-nothing pride!
It's rare that a Saiyan
would be so hung up on it.
Wh-What power!
That ain't true. Vegeta has
far more pride than even I do.
Hmph, now that you mention it,
he forsook his pride earlier,
to protect the others.
I know. He forsook even
his pride as the prince.
Ain't that amazing?
I kind of respect him for that.
And that's why you also forsook
your pride to turn God, right?
That's right.
I wonder what those two are talking about.
It's almost as though
Goku were receiving training.
I should also say that there's
something I'm dissatisfied with.
Huh? What's that?
I still haven't even come
close to fighting all-out.
Oh, really? I was going at
about 80 percent of all-out.
Huh? 80 percent?
Then let's see if you can
keep up with this speed!
What's the matter?
Do you mean business yet?
Yeah! I mean business!
What's this? Using blasts now?!
Page 37/43
Ha! This isn't some sporting event!
Stop enjoying destroying things!
He's not God!
He's reverted to a mere Super Saiyan!
C-Can you see them, Kuririn?
No, I can't.
If you're gonna start
using blasts against me...
...then I...
...have one for you!
Go ahead. Feel free.
Hal!
That's Goku's Kamehame-Ha!
Hmm? What's that?
I'll return the favor!
I'll take it, just like this!
Wh-What is that?
Beers' attack! Th-This is bad!
Damn it...!
Apparently, you haven't
realized it, yourself.
Wh-What?
Your Super Saiyan God
time ran out a good while ago.
R-Really?
B-But...
It seems as though while you
had turned God and were fighting me,
you absorbed that world into your body.
Which is why, even though
you've returned to normal,
you haven't powered down all
that much. You're something else.
I might even say you're one
of those rarely-seen prodigies.
If that's true, then I'm glad...
Then openly recognize that joy.
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
I can't do that. The first
matter at hand right now...
...is still how huge the
difference in our powers is!
Then give up and bow out!
What is going on?
Page 38/43
Damn it...!
Goku-sa!
...Goku! ...Kakarrot! ...Father!
Hey, what did you just do?
L-I don't know.
You don't know?
You are a fascinating one.
What? Why did you stop?
I wanted to get you to say "I give up."
I give up. I give "P!
Beers-same, you sure are strong.
There ain't no way I could stand up to you.
You're the strongest
in the universe, all right.
It looks like you finally realize
the terror of Beers the Destroyer.
However, you are definitely
strong, yourself.
In the long, long history
of fights I've been through,
you are the second-strongest.
Huh? Wh-What, only second place?
All right, let me tell
you one last thing...
What? That you've
decided not to destroy earth?
No, I can't do that.
I make it a rule not to
change my mind once it's made up.
Then, wh-what...?
My attendant, a man named
Whis, is over there, right?
Huh? Y-Yeah...
While he may be my
attendant, he is also my teacher.
Eh? T-Teacher?! Then, the
strongest one in the universe is...
This world is the "7th Universe."
I am the Destroyer for the 7th Universe.
There are 12 universes in all, you see.
Don't you expect that there are
even more fantastic guys out there?
Goku-sa!
...Goku!
Page 39/43
...Son-kun!
L-I'm all right. I'm still alive.
Well then, as promised,
I will now destroy earth.
Oh my, Beers-sama, you destroyed
just a small piece of earth, huh?
Hmph, that's too bad. I guess
I don't have enough strength left.
I'll have to destroy it
completely some other time.
Beers-sama...
You there, when Beers-sama passes away,
would you be the next Destroyer?
Hey!
I'm afraid not.
That's too bad.
Mrs. Vegeta...
Huh? Me? Wh-What?
I'm sorry for all the commotion.
Never mind that, apologize for hitting me!
S-Sorry.
Hey, what are you, dim?!
If you don't mind, please
invite us to your next party.
If you promise not to act up.
Agreed. And this time, I'm going
to have some of that pudding.
I'll have the whole pool
filled and ready for you.
However, don't go telling me
you don't like it after you eat it.
If I don't like it, I really will
destroy the earth this time.
Then we'll get to fight
again, right, Beers-sama?
Farewell.
Unbelievable.
Absolutely right.
Beers the Destroyer did not destroy them.
Could it be because of the
marvelous character of Son Goku?
He keeps making more and more friends...
...until now, at last, even Beers-sama...
No,
Page 40/43
we can't say it was
entirely because of Son Goku.
It's that whole group...
no, it may even be because
of the whole earth.
Son Goku, who was supposed
to have been a savage Saiyan,
to say nothing of Vegeta,
changed after coming to earth.
Humankind aside, it really
is a wonderful planet, isn't it?
Those people have all sorts of problems,
but they are brimming
with a wondrous charm.
I guess that was kind of fun.
I have to admit, his latent
ability is something unfathomable.
Although, I wouldn't
call him an arch-rival.
Even so, it's been a long
time since I've seen you
have to use nearly 70 percent
of your power, Beers-sama.
What was his name again?
Son Goku.
Between him and Vegeta,
they really might become my
arch-rivals before too long, huh?
You seem pleased by that.
As are you, aren't you, Whis?
It can become dull when
we both live so long.
Besides which, I do not sleep.
Well, I'm a bit tired,
so I think I'll take a three-year nap.
Three years? That is a
fairly brief snooze, isn't it?
There appear to be many more
delicious things on earth, after all.
Sure enough, you did not
feel like destroying earth
after finding how delicious the food is.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Ah, come to think of it...
Page 41/43
I had them pack us something
absolutely delicious, called sushi,
for us to bring back with us.
Beers-sama, would you like some?
Or would you rather sleep?
Ha! I'll have some, of course!
It looks like you sampled
quite a bit of tasty food
while I was off fighting, huh, Whis?
Oh, this is some beautiful food, isn't it?
You apply a little of this fluid,
called soy sauce, and eat it.
What is this little green lump here?
That? Ah, now that you mention it,
the chef said "Use it as you like,"
and that it was called "wasabi."
Ah, come to think of it,
I did hear you talking about that.
While I was fighting.
Let me go get us something to drink.
Let's see, here...
That won't do!
Yow-w-w... That was mean of you.
Beers-sama, you do take out your
temper on innocent worlds, after all.
Hmph. This is all earth's fault.
All right, let's head back to
earth right now, and destroy it!
My word, after I said "Use it as you like,"
you are the one who gulped
it down, right, Beers-sama?
Well then, let's make it
"if I don't like the taste of sushi,
it means destruction!" instead.
Now then, please wake me
in another three years.
It was good, wasn't it?
Okay, good night.
Ah, Beers-sama, be sure to
brush before you go to sleep.
Huh? Yeah... all right, all right...
Okay, one more time, then!
Bulma-san, happy...
...birthday!
Page 42/43
Yeah! 38 years old!
Shut up!
Let's drink!
When you're backed into a corner,
you may be more fearsome than anything.
Hey, Kakarrot, next time,
I'm the one who gets to turn God!
You be sure to cooperate with me.
Yeah, of course! But when you
overexert yourself to get stronger,
it leaves you all worn out afterward!
Oh, come to think of it, Vegeta,
when Bulma got hit, you were all,
"My Bulma!", got angry, and turned
into an awesome Super Saiyan, huh?
I felt so loved!
L-I don't remember saying that!
J-Just that, at the time,
I definitely think I surpassed you!
Yeah, you sure did.
Next time, when we fight
someone who gives us trouble,
have him slap Bulma for us.
Hey!
I thought you weren't here
when Vegeta went off like that.
You arrived long before that,
using your Instantaneous Movement,
to see how things played out, didn't you?
Uh, well...
Son-kun'.!
Is that true, you jerk?!
While everyone else was getting beat up?!
Sorry! Sorry! I was watching
the enemy's movement,
trying to put together a strategy,
but well, I didn't come up with anything.
Bulma! Smack him two or three more times!
Yes, Sir!
Whoa, I'm sorry! I know I made a mistake!

Dragon Ball Z:
Resurrection of F
By Unknown
Page 1/30
1
--Hey. pouty-pants!
--Pouty-pants! Pouty-pants!
Sorbet-sama...
What is it?
Planet 448, sir.
The native uprising has gotten worse,
and the situation is becoming untenable.
Increase the number of soldiers.
The trouble is, with all
the fighting on other worlds,
we can only send a few more soldiers.
What?
Damn. Disengage. Disengage!
This is Sorbet. Tell me,
have you found the planet
with the remaining surviving Namekians yet?
I am terribly sorry, Sorbet-sama.
We are using a large number of spy cameras,
but as before, we have
been unable to locate them.
Tch! Then there's no other
choice but to go to earth.
Earth? But that's dangerous, isn't it?
The woman who is said to be
able to search for Dragon Balls
is in league with that Super Saiyan!
If we can't find the Namekians,
we have no choice but to go to earth.
Besides, according to the
data the spy cameras scouted out,
the woman isn't the only one
who can find the Dragon Balls.
I know the data showed that there was one other.
Tagoma! The two of us are going to earth!
Yes, sir. But only the two of us are going?
Hmph
The earth Saiyans seem to have the ability
to detect substantial battle
powers without using a Scouter.
If we go in larger numbers,
there is a risk of us being noticed.
I see. Understood.
Sorbet-sama, you're going personally?
Page 2/30
Of course.
Freeza-sama is coming back to life!
Sorbet-sama, I've found them! There they are!
What?
They already have a number of them gathered.
All right, hurry!
We have to catch them before
they find them all, no matter what!
Yes, sir!
Well? The last one is here, right?
Y-Yes, it should be directly below us,
but this is trouble.
The sea floor here, of all places,
is considerably deep.
Tagoma, dive in and retrieve it.
Yes, sir.
Excuse us just a moment...
Mai, it's because you couldn't find
them quickly with the Dragon Radar
that those crazy aliens are going
to snatch them from us, you know!
Pilaf-sama, you should turn them down flat!
At this point, you take your gun,
and Shou, you use your katana, and...
Pow-pow-pow-pow! Take care of them!
Huh? Pilaf-sama, aren't you going to fight?
I'm supposed to be the brains here,
but what choice is there?
Let's do it!
Just because I'm small,
you shouldn't take me too lightly.
--We're not taking you lightly!
--We're terribly sorry for this!
I'm sorry we're getting back a little late.
Huh?
Pan-chan, sorry we're so late.
Uncle Piccolo sure is nice,
even for someone green, huh?
Hmph! Hmm?
Huh? What's the matter?
I'm sensing an unpleasant Ki in that direction.
Eh? Ah, now that you mention it...
What could it be?
I don't know.
Page 3/30
Ah, there, there. I'm sorry.
We're late, aren't we?
Okay, get started.
Y-You're not going to kill us or
anything once we're done, right?
Don't worry. It's possible that
we may still have a use for you later.
What, you doubt me?
No, not at all.
I-I have a boyfriend named Trunks!
Get started already!
C-Come forth, Shen Long! And grant me my wish!
It just got dark. It couldn't be...
Shen Long? But where?
Now, speak thy wish.
I shall grant thee any wish.
G-Go ahead.
Sorbet-sama, quickly!
A-All right.
Okay, here goes.
Bring Freeza-sama back to life!
Wh-What's the matter?
You will grant any wish, right?
Of course, it is possible.
However, that being's body
was cut to pieces long ago,
and cannot be regenerated.
There is little point in
bringing his soul back like this.
Freeza!
I-Is that right?
That would be bad, huh?
Sorbet-sama, even dismembered,
with the latest regeneration
machine our forces now use,
it may be possible to restore him.
Oh yeah! You're right. Okay!
Hey! It doesn't matter if he's in pieces.
Bring him back to life now!
You certainly are bossy.
B-Bring Freeza-sama back to life... please.
What's the use? Very well.
Now then, speak thy next wish.
What? Next wish? You can grant two?
Page 4/30
Yes. When earth's Kami changed,
I was also renewed.
Two... Two, huh?
Maybe I should bring
Papa Freeza-sama back, as well.
I want 1,000,000 zeni!
Thy wish has been granted.
And now, farewell.
Wh-Why that little punk!
Sorbet-sama,
we must hurry. The Saiyans may be coming.
Okay, let me go! I know we have
a cryopreservation device packed!
Go and get it at once!
Yes, sir!
This is Freeza-sama we're talking about.
With his life force and our technology,
we can definitely bring him back!
Um, excuse me...
You forgot something.
Here you go.
Good job. I will be back here again shortly.
This time with Freeza-sama, and my soldiers.
Nice going, Shou.
As long as you were asking,
you could have made it a huge fortune,
like a hundred million zeni.
I was just thinking that with that much money,
we could eat very well for a while.
I get it! All right, let's go
get some Mongolian barbecue!
--With pudding! With pudding, too!
--Yay! Good food! Good food!
It's gone. I wonder what that was.
I have a bad feeling about this.
W-Welcome home, Freeza-sama.
Hmm? Who are you?
I-I am Sorbet. I was on your
staff before, in the 3rd Stellar Region.
Ah, you do look a little familiar.
Presently, I am leading our
forces in your place, Freeza-sama.
You are?
Apparently, I really have come back to life.
Page 5/30
Yes, sir, using the Dragon Balls
and our new regenerative machine.
Dragon Balls? Ah, those mysterious
orbs the Namekians possess?
We could not find the Namekians,
so Tagoma and I went to earth,
and used the Balls that are there.
I am Tagoma. I assisted
in your revival, Freeza-sama.
I am Sisami, sir.
They are outstanding warriors,
rivaling even the now late
Zarbon-sama and Dodoria-sama.
Hmm. Well done, men.
Incidentally, it took a great deal
of time for you to revive me, yes?
I-I am terribly sorry.
Between the Dragon Balls
and the regenerative machine,
there were many preparations
that needed to be made.
The suffering was quite terrible,
there in earth's Hell.
We are glad that you are back.
Hmph. I will wager that things
did not go well without me being here,
which is why you decided
to revive me, is it not?
N-No, sir, not at all. However,
while time may have passed,
that has allowed us to develop
our new regenerative machine,
permitting you to return
completely to your previous form.
And Papa?
We thought that we would
revive you alone, Freeza-sama,
and your father the next time around.
Hmph. You do not have to revive Papa.
He is always so high-and-mighty
about everything, after all.
Huh? Y-Yes, sir. As you wish.
Sure enough, it appears
that my skills are a bit rusty.
Page 6/30
It may require some time
before I am able to take my revenge.
R-Revenge, sir?
But of course. I will not
be content until I eliminate
the two Super Saiyans
who put me through all of this.
Forgive me for saying so, sir,
but I think it wisest to ignore them,
and instead, work as before to...
S-Sorbet-sama!
Tagoma!
Sh-Shields! Raise the shields!
The Freeza force appears to have grown
quite fainthearted during
my absence, has it not?
Do you intend to allow the
universe's finest, the Freeza force,
to work while cowering to a handful of Saiyans?
B-But the Saiyan named Son Goku...
w-went on to become even...
What? Are you telling me
he became even stronger?
Y-Yes, sir. As difficult
as it is for me to say so...
I expected as much. I just have
to become even stronger than he is.
He even defeated Majin Boo.
We have no data after that, though.
Majin Boo? Papa said that under no circumstances
was I to take action against
Beers the Destroyer or Majin Boo.
That Majin?
Y-Yes, sir.
That is better than I imagined.
Still, does that not make this interesting?
I-interesting, sir?
I was born naturally gifted, after all.
I have never done any kind of training before,
nor was there ever any need for it.
Y-Yes, sir.
I wonder what will happen...
once I go through training,
to draw out all of my latent abilities.
Page 7/30
A-Are you saying you will become even stronger?
Of course. By my prediction, let me see...
if I train earnestly for four months,
I should be able to reach
a battle power of 1,300,000.
I already told you,
I'm a super-elite galactic patrolman!
Hurry up and go get Bulma for me!
Like I said, you cannot see
her without an appointment!
You fool! I've come a long way
to tell her the earth is in danger!
Oh, if it isn't Zako-kun.
It's not "Zako," it's "Jaco."
[Zako:
Long time no see. What do you say?
Do you want me to show
you my adorable goldfish?
Goldfish?
Oh, their eyes are big, like an Erukan's.
Those are popeyed goldfish.
What do you think? Cute, huh?
Oh, no! Call Bulma for me!
O-Okay.
Ah, you're right. It's Jaco!
Long time no see, isn't it?
What brings you here?
I heard from your sister, Tights,
that you were friends with the man
who defeated Freeza. Is that true?
Huh? Yeah. There are two people
who have defeated Freeza.
One of them is my son Trunks;
the other is my friend Son-kun.
Your son?
By son, I mean my son who came
from the future in a time machine.
Right now, he's still a little boy.
From the future? That's pretty flagrant of you.
Time control is a serious
crime under galactic law!
I don't know anything about those laws.
W-Well, never mind. Let me meet
Page 8/30
this friend of yours right away.
I have to tell him something.
That could be difficult.
Right now, he's with Beers-sama,
together with my husband.
Beers?
You're in the Galactic Patrol,
and you don't know? Beers the Destroyer.
Beers the Destroyer?
That's quite impossible! Beers is just a myth.
If that's what you think, then fine.
This is no time for you to be so happy-go-lucky.
Freeza has come back to life,
and he is heading toward
earth with 1,000 soldiers!
Huh? Freeza? You mean,
the same Freeza that put me through
all that trouble on Planet Namek?
Although, I don't know exactly who he is...
This is him.
That's Freeza?
He couldn't have come
back to life. Seriously?
Seriously.
With 1,000 soldiers?!
Yes!
I'm just letting you know,
I'm getting out of here.
That's because I'm still young,
and I don't want to die.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
You should tell me something
that important first! Hold on!
Hey, wait up!
Did they say Freeza?
Whis-san!
Whis-san, this is a strawberry sundae!
If you want it, contact me at once!
Otherwise, it will melt!
What are you doing, at a time like this?
I sure hope he contacts me soon.
Say, Jaco, when is Freeza coming?
Hmm... I'd say in another hour.
You dummy! That's in no time at all, isn't it?!
Page 9/30
I have to hurry and let the others know!
Dummy?
Hey! Let's get going!
We did it! We'll be millionaires now!
We sure did it, Boss!
Whoa! Y-You idiot! Stop squirming!
Sorry...
They're coming after us! Yikes, better floor it!
R-Right!
Damn, this guy's persistent!
How do you like this?!
You dumb-ass!
That was dangerous, you know!
"That was dangerous, you know"?
No, you're the ones who are dangerous, you know!
Come on, guys, no more
committing robberies. Aah!
W-We're sorry! We won't do
it again! Please forgive us!
Yow-w-w...
Huh? It's Bulma-san.
Yes, this is Kuririn. This is a bad time,
Bulma-san. I'm on duty.
Eh? Freeza?! But that's impossible.
Right... Right... Understood.
I'll get ready at once!
I'll handle contacting
Muten Roshi-sama. Okay, goodbye.
Freeza... has come back to life?
I'm coming, too. My battle power
is much higher than all of yours.
No. 18, you stay here and keep Marron safe.
And more importantly, I need a favor.
Can you take care of my head?
You say Son Goku and Vegeta are
both at Beers' place, and not here?
Yeah, we're waiting to hear back from them.
I sure hope they get here soon.
But luckily, Gohan is around,
so that's encouraging.
All right, I'm off!
Pretty cool.
We will arrive at earth shortly, Freeza-sama.
Incidentally, I understand that Son Goku
Page 10/30
is the only Saiyan who
defeated me that you can find.
Yes, sir. We started looking right
after you passed on, Freeza-sama,
but no matter where we looked,
we could not find the other one.
Perhaps he went to some
other world, or maybe he is deceased.
We believe that the only Saiyans
on earth are Son Goku and Vegeta,
as well as Son Goku's son.
Well, that will do.
But Freeza-sama, once you
have successfully taken revenge,
he can be brought back
to life with the Dragon Balls.
Hmph. If I destroy earth while I am at it,
then the Dragon Balls, as well
as that Hell, will cease to exist.
I-I see.
Incidentally, do you remember
the emergency plan, just in case?
O-Of course, sir.
Very good.
Oh, the flowers...
What are you daydreaming about?!
Damn it! Mock us, will you?!
Yowch-ch-ch...
Kakarrot, what the hell
have you been aiming for?!
Vegeta, you can't say that.
My, my...
Kakarrot, you keep out of this!
I'll take him alone this time!
Eh? Vegeta!
Here.
Gotcha.
C-Can't move...!
I've finally caught you! Wh-What?!
Okay, stop, stop!
This will not do. You are
still utterly lacking in speed.
Look, I even signed your tops.
Huh? When did you...?
Page 11/30
You two are still thinking
with your heads in order to move.
That tendency is especially
strong with you, Vegeta-san.
Doing so puts a limit on your speed.
It takes time for your brain and your senses
to travel along your nerves
and go throughout your bodies.
That's definitely true for you, Vegeta.
Shut up! Are you sure you're not just a moron?!
You just have to have each area of
your body think and move on its own,
but that is very difficult.
Not even Beers-sama has completely mastered it.
If you can overcome it, you will
also be able to avoid any danger.
Now, let me take the time
to take you meticulously through this training.
In exchange for something delicious, that is.
Are you saying you can do that?
Of course.
But Whis-san, you're stepping in doo-doo.
Shoes do not think for themselves, after all.
By the way, Vegeta-san...
Wh-What?
You being a gifted fighter notwithstanding,
you always seem to lag one
step behind Goku-san, don't you?
Tch! Th-Thanks for spelling it out.
Do you know why that is?
How should I know?!
Your nerves are always wound too tightly.
When you do that,
you cannot operate at full capacity.
It is important to get enough
rest when it's time to relax.
The way Goku-san does.
Ha-ha, he's right, Vegeta.
But, on the other hand...
Yeow! What did you do that for?!
...being too relaxed is also a problem.
Also, your overconfidence
in yourself is another problem.
No matter how strong you are,
Page 12/30
if you let your mind wander,
your body becomes something fragile.
You show many occasions
when you are too sure of yourself,
and let your guard down.
Hm-hmm, he's right.
Ow-w-w... Th-That ain't fair!
What is this? You're too noisy.
I can't sleep, you know!
Y-Yikes! If we had taken that head-on,
nothing would be left of us!
He's always like this when he's sleepy.
When he destroyed those two suns over there,
it was awful how dark things became.
How did you put the suns back?
Can you make stars?
No, in cases like this, I perform a do-over.
Do-over?
I back time up just a little bit,
and before he can do something dumb,
I give him a quick bop on the head.
Who the hell are you, exactly?
How shall I put this? The life form named Whis?
Still, I do have my hands full with Beers-sama.
He's always like this, after all.
It's true. He never listens to me.
--Hey, how come you guys are here?
--Really? Beers-sama can be a pain, huh?
E-Eep! H-Hey, Beers-sama.
We're having Whis-san train us.
I can tell that just by looking.
I mean, how did you get here?
We contacted Whis-san,
and had him bring us here.
We ain't able to sense your Ki,
so that's the only thing we can do.
Whis brought you?
Hmph, I'll just bet that you bribed
him with something yummy, huh?
Well, yeah.
Why do you want to get stronger so badly?
You wouldn't be gunning for
the job of Destroyer, would you?
It ain't that. I just wanna
Page 13/30
get stronger, that's all.
And I don't want to be left in
the dust by this bastard, that's all.
You two really don't get along well, do you?
If you two worked together,
you seem like you would be able
to go toe-to-toe against Beers-sama.
Nobody asked you what you think, Whis.
Hmph, I'd rather die than team up with him.
I ain't got any problem
with playing nice with him,
but when I fight, I want to do it alone.
My, my...
Hmph... So, what is it?
The treat you brought with you.
Ah, this time, it is something called pizza.
Oh... What an interesting name.
Don't tell me you ate it all, did you?
Beers-sama, we saved enough for you.
Well then, I think I'll have some.
But you interrupted my sleep.
If it's not delicious, I'm going
to destroy you, understand?
Well then, I will go warm it up
for you, so it tastes better.
Wait a minute. Whis, you just
said "this time," didn't you?
I get the feeling that this isn't
the first time you've come here.
What is that?!
They're here!
Somewhere near Metro North!
Make a little room, there.
That is just my way of saying hello.
Th-That bastard! Now he's done it!
I left Chaozu and Yamucha behind.
The danger seems too much for them.
Per Bulma-san's orders, Trunks-kun
and Goten haven't been told, either.
They would do something rash.
Hey!
Sorry we're late.
We stopped by Karin-sama's
tower for some senzu beans.
Page 14/30
Kuririn-san! Seeing your head
like that sure takes me back!
Yeah, I know. I'm all geared up!
But never mind me,
Gohan, what's with your getup?
Y-Yeah... It happened so suddenly,
I couldn't find my gi.
Gohan, have you been keeping
your martial arts training up?
I-I'm sorry, no. But I can still
turn Super Saiyan. Probably.
Is Son Goku not here yet?
H-He'll be here soon. Just wait!
Oh, it is you. I am sure I remember killing you.
It would seem you have come
back to life with the Dragon Balls, too.
The Dragon Balls?
Th-Then sure enough, earlier...
B-By any chance, is that guy
riding in that round thing Freeza?
You have a surprisingly
good talent for drawing, huh?
Bulma-san! Why would you come out here?!
I had no luck at all contacting
Son-kun and Vegeta,
so I had no choice but to come.
Okay, you come on down, too,
and fight alongside them.
No way. I said I was only going to drop you off.
What gives? You're a proud,
super-elite galactic patrolman, right?
A-All right. Okay, I'll be in
charge of the rest of the enemy army.
Who's that guy?
Beats me. Bulma-san
has a lot of strange friends.
Hmph, I thought he might be a Super Saiyan,
but that symbol is for the Galactic Patrol.
Hey, you!
You really don't give up, do you?
How did you come back to life?!
Y-You idiot! You could at
least speak to him more politely!
Oh, seeing as how you know who I am,
Page 15/30
might you have also been there on Planet Namek?
Where is your friend, Son Goku-san?
What? You're just now coming
here to take your revenge?
A lot has happened, and things
have been delayed considerably.
You'll be a pushover for
Son-kun the way he is now!
Shouldn't you leave now,
while you still have a chance?
Bulma, don't provoke him!
And here I have come all this way.
I suppose if all of his friends were killed,
it would be quite upsetting to him.
Gohan-kun, knowing you,
you can take him right out, can't you?
All of his soldiers, probably.
But Bulma-san, while you might
not realize this, Freeza is bad news.
He is so much more greatly
powered-up than he was before,
it would be fair to say
he's a whole different person.
I'm sorry, but...
Huh? O-Oh, no...
I-I'm sorry! Son-kun is off far away right now.
Wait just a little longer. Please?
I have waited quite a long time
for this moment to come already.
Very well. I shall wait another ten seconds.
T-Ten seconds?!
What? What a stinge!
Well then, let us begin.
Soldiers! Let them have it!
Here they come!
Hmph! Okay, let's go!
Everyone take... let's see...
About 170 of them is your quota!
Hang in there until Goku and Vegeta arrive!
Kamehame-Ha!!
Uh-oh.
Bam!
The odds are against us
like this! Everyone, scatter!
Page 16/30
They may be Freeza's force, but
they're still a hodgepodge bunch. Okay!
This may be too much for me.
Kikoho!
Ka... me... ha... me...
Can't you go easy on an old man?! Hal!
Kienzan!!
Here's a present!
What did you do, you bastard?!
You can have one, too.
Whoo, that feels lighter.
Say your prayers!
These guys don't let up!
Thanks, Gohan. You saved me.
Not at all. Are you okay?
Kuririn-san, please get a little rest.
I'll be right back.
Let him have it!
I don't know who you are,
but you're pretty good!
What about you? Who are you guys?
I'm an earthling.
What? You're too strong to be one,
and your face looks too funny.
Cram it!
H-How can this be? Th-These guys...
This is not surprising at all.
If he wanted to, Son Goku's son over there
could put them all away in a single instant.
He is intentionally fighting
so as not to kill anyone.
He is too kind, much like his father.
You see, as heinous as I am,
Son Goku did not try to kill even me.
What a man of fine character he is.
It makes me feel positively nauseous!
Freeza-sama, Sorbet-sama,
I will head out as well.
Mm-hmm, you do that.
Let me handle this one.
Makankosappou!
Did that get him?
Piccolo-san!
Gohan!
Page 17/30
Piccolo-san, please leave him to me!
Wh-What?!
Th-This can't be! Not Sisami, too!
You have only seen video images of them,
so you do not comprehend
the true terror of a Super Saiyan.
I did not think the son
could transform, however.
Here.
Here.
I don't need one.
Finally, he's stepping forward, is he?
My, my. Not that I was unaware of this,
but the quality of the Freeza
force has fallen considerably.
S-Sorry...
Th-They're more formidable...
than we expected...
No matter.
However, your lying about all over
like this is unpleasant to look at.
Watch out! Get back!
Wh-What a monster.
Y-You're all pretty incredible, all right.
The biggest threat of all still remains, though.
The terror of Freeza is legendary,
even among the Galactic Patrol.
Word is that he's ridiculously strong.
Yeah, I know that!
And what are you doing over here?
The crucial part is just
getting started, you know!
Don't be absurd. I've put in
more than my share of action.
You think I'm going to fight
against the evil emperor Freeza?
Count me out this time for sure!
What do you think? Can the five
of us manage anything against him?
No, not a chance.
He's a monster on an entirely
different level than we are.
Then you think so, too. That's a real shame.
You do not seem to be coming at me, do you?
Page 18/30
This is dull, so what do you say I pass
the time by killing you, one at a time?
You are Son Goku's child, yes?
You certainly have grown up big.
Gohan!
Even with you being a Super Saiyan,
it appears that you are no match
for what I have now become.
Hey, Gohan! Th-This is bad!
His heart has stopped!
He can't eat a senzu!
Move!
Here.
My, this is a surprise. It seems
that you possess a wonder drug.
Still, how much time are you
going to be able to buy with it?
How many senzu do we have left?
Just one.
Whis!
Yes, what is it?
What was this called again?
This gooey, stretchy stuff?
Let's see... Yes, what was it called?
Cheese.
Yes, cheese. It's a little pungent,
but has a wonderful flavor.
Beers-sama, don't go
interrupting our training over that.
What? You take that kind of
smart-aleck tone with a Destroyer?
Look, don't forget that the reason
the earth that you guys are from
was not destroyed by me is
because of its delicious foods!
A-All right. Sorry.
Hey, Whis, take a look.
A message from earth
arrived for you a good while ago.
Oh, you're right. I have a missed call.
I wonder if this might be another
scrumptious message from Bulma-san.
Sure enough. Oh, a strawberry sundae?
It does look both gorgeous and delicious.
Page 19/30
I am quite intrigued.
Let me just check in with her...
Hurry it up, Whis!
Hello? This strawberry sundae item of yours
wouldn't happen to be a
form of sweets, would it?
Ah! Whis-san?
Hey, you! You took your time
getting back to me, didn't you?!
Vegeta and Son-kun are there, right?
Tell them to come back right now!
That evil scumbag Freeza has come back to life,
and right now, the earth is in a real mess!
S-Scumbag?
What?!
"Freeza?!
What do you mean!
That's impossible! How can Freeza be...?!
All right! We'll have
Whis-san bring us back right now!
It will take about 35 minutes.
We can't wait that long!
Son-kun, you can use Instantaneous
Movement, right? Don't be a dummy!
Ah! But it's so far away,
I ain't sure I can sense any Ki on earth.
Freeza's Ki is a huge one,
so I'll bet you can latch on to it!
Hey! Son-kun is going to use
his Instantaneous Movement,
so all of you raise your
powers to their maximum!
Huh? O-Okay!
Wh-What is this?
It would seem that they
are calling out... to him.
I've got him! Hey, Vegeta!
Wh-What? You want me to hold your hand?!
Hurry up! Bulma could be getting killed!
She's got a smart mouth, after all.
Okay, off we go!
--Goku!
--Father!
Are we in time?
Page 20/30
Yeah.
Well, it was close, there.
Your timing is always
like this, for Pete's sake.
He-he, sorry, sorry.
You are finally here.
I have been waiting quite a while.
I am surprised to see that
Vegeta-san is with you, as well.
Still, the time for my vengeance
against you is finally at hand.
It really does look like it's Freeza.
How did that happen?
They used the Dragon Balls.
About six months ago, wasn't it?
Earth's Hell truly was a hell.
Not only were my powers taken from me,
I was strung up like a bagworm moth,
and placed in a field of flowers,
in a clearing in the woods
where angels and fairies lived.
At times, I had to watch cute stuffed animals
dance around, and hold parades.
Do you have any idea how
much anguish that caused me?
That ain't on me. You're the one
who came to earth on your own,
and got yourself killed by Trunks, ain't you?
You see,
just having you still be alive
ensures that I do not sleep well.
So you see, after coming back to life,
I have been training, to make
sure I was not beaten by you again.
Such efforts were a first for me.
Me, of all people!
Sure, your level may have risen even higher.
But don't you think I've gotten stronger, too?
Quite frankly, last time,
I was caught off-guard.
This time, I will start
right off in my final form!
Wha--?
Just what kind of training did you do?
Page 21/30
Th-This is not good.
Hey, everyone, get back even farther!
You ain't no pushover, that's for sure.
If you weren't rotten to the core,
you would have made a good rival.
What a waste.
More of your usual utterances
that irritate me so, I see.
Oh, are you not going to turn Super Saiyan?
Right now, I don't even have to resort to that.
Ho, you do seem sure of yourself.
You might say.
Hmph, well then, how about
I begin exacting my revenge?
How is that possible?
Goku hasn't taken a single blow,
even against a monster like that!
It's like I'm having a nightmare.
Who ever thought there
would be an earthling like that?
He is originally a Saiyan, though.
Saiyan? What is a Saiyan,
a warrior race that's supposed
to be extinct, doing on earth?
My husband over there is also a Saiyan.
Huh? H-How can that be?
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
I'm the one who oversees earth.
I don't need the trouble.
Take this!
You done already?
That's enough, damn it!
We decided we would take turns fighting!
Ee-yow!
It's still too soon!
Wh-What are those two doing?!
I see. He must still have
some sense of loyalty remaining.
You stay out of this, Vegeta.
I am here to defeat Son Goku-san.
There, you see? Let me go a
little longer, and then we'll switch.
Hmph. Damn.
This is unexpected. I know
Page 22/30
quite a bit of time has passed,
but I did not imagine that you
would have improved this much.
Didn't I tell you so?
Then I am glad that I trained.
I knew it. You've still
got something hidden, huh?
Well deduced. But then, so do you, right?
Let's both go all-out.
Nothing more up our sleeves.
All right, then. You first.
Are you sure? It will take
all the wind out of your sails.
All right, let me show you!
They're coming back down!
What are they planning to do?
How about that?
So you end up turning Super Saiyan again?
But this is a little different.
It's a bit complicated and hard to explain,
but this is a Super Saiyan level
with the power of Super Saiyan God.
Thank goodness.
This could have proven dangerous for me.
I was right to challenge myself
to evolve even further, just in case.
Stop building it up and show me, already.
A-Awesome...!
Wh-What them?
I settled on gold-colored,
to make it easy for you to understand.
Perhaps it was too on the nose.
If you will forgive the tacky naming,
shall we call this "Golden Freeza"?
But then, you appear to realize
that my color is not the
only thing that has changed.
Yeah. I'm excited for this,
but I didn't expect you to come this far,
so my heart's pounding a bit, too.
This could prove to be quite
the complicated battle, yes?
You could say that.
Hey, Vegeta! You about ready to trade yet?
Page 23/30
D-Don't start getting smarmy on me!
You're the one that Freeza is after!
Well, let me give this a shot.
Hello!
B-Beers-sama! Whis-san!
Bulma-san, we are here
for that strawberry sundae.
You do have it with you, do you not?
Huh? Oh, yeah. I did bring it with me.
And it tastes good, right?
We came a long way, just for this.
If it isn't, I'll destroy you.
Now is not the time for that!
A-All right! It might have
melted a little bit, though.
I must have put too much power into that one.
Okay, here you go.
Whoa! That looks tasty, doesn't it?
Well then...
Oh! This uses the ice cream
that we had before as its base, right?
These look like the brains from
the giant frogs on Planet Manu.
Oh! This is a fruit? These are lush
and invigorating, and tasty, Whis!
I have already had one.
I must say, while this is simple,
it is still a delicious dessert.
By the way, Freeza has upped
his game quite a bit, huh?
Goku-san is having trouble with him, isn't he?
Oh, Bulma-san! This white stuff is
different from the ice cream, isn't it?
Y-Yeah, that is fresh whipped cream.
I see Vegeta isn't fighting
alongside him, all right.
If he did, they could beat him.
Those two will definitely never
pair up. Their pride is too great.
What fools.
I am with you!
I hate to admit it, but I'm
a little bit on the ropes here...
So it would seem.
Page 24/30
You really are an awesome son-of-a-gun.
It took me a long time
to get to where I am, too.
Playing on my mercy will do you no good.
I commend you for putting up a good fight,
but you are, after all, just a Saiyan.
This time, I will smash you into little pieces!
G-Great!
B-Beers!
What's this, Freeza? No honorific on my name?
B-Beers-sama! Wh-What are you doing here?
Can't you see for yourself?
I'm here to eat this!
A-Are you planning to interfere with my revenge?
Ha! None of that matters to me!
Do as you please.
But do it someplace a little farther away.
You'll get dust all over my delicious dessert.
Then you will not get involved, right?
I told you to do as you please.
I am a Destroyer. I take neither side.
Hold on! You're not going to help?
A fight is a fight.
What are you talking about?!
Everyone's going to get killed!
Buzz off! It's all right. As long
as there's something tasty to eat,
I'll make sure that you, at least,
are spared. Stay close to me.
Hey, is that really Beers the Destroyer?
That's right.
Do you think I could get
a picture of him with me?
You can always ask him yourself.
Don't blame me if you get destroyed, though.
Okay, never mind.
Well, shall we continue with my revenge?
You still wanna go?
You'd better leave now on a
high note, while you're still winning.
After you've come all
the way back to life, and all.
Do you really think I would leave,
when victory is right in front of me?
Page 25/30
Kakarrot, you can trade out now if you want.
Aw, no fair! You must have
spotted Freeza's weakness, too, right?
Weakness?
What a ridiculous thing to say.
After fighting me just now,
you ought to know better.
What weakness are you talking about?
It ain't here just yet.
You were so obsessed with taking revenge
that you came here immediately
after achieving that
"Golden Freeza" state, didn't you?
So what about it?
You're consuming your power at an alarming rate.
You should have waited until you
were accustomed to it before coming.
Hmph, is that it? Then I shall hurry up
and kill you right away!
Take this!
What?!
It looks like the tables are
starting to turn, just like they said.
Just a moment, please.
That strawberry was my strawberry.
You liar! How many have you eaten?!
Three of them.
Well, I've had two.
No, you have eaten four of them.
There were a total of eight strawberries.
What does it matter? I am a deity.
Ka...
...me...
...ha...
...me...
---Ha!!
l-I'll just take this and...!
Got him!
See? Just like I said. Now take
my advice. Go on and leave, now.
I promise you, I will fight you again.
No, damn it!!
Why?!
Why?!
Page 26/30
This should not be happening!
That was good work, Sorbet.
Th-Thank you very much!
It really is a good thing that
I had this planned, just in case.
Goku!
Okay, your naptime is now over.
Oh, dear. Didn't I tell him so?
That was fighting dirty, but still
nicely done by Freeza, wasn't it?
Your leniency really is your weakness.
Being so overly strong, you have
a bad habit of lowering your guard.
As tough as your body may be,
you are still taken down
with a single shot from a ray gun.
How must that feel?
You are the one who is out of luck.
You won the fight, but you have lost the battle!
The moment I have been
dreaming of has finally come!
However, it would not be as fun
if I were to just kill you like this.
Vegeta-san, would you like me to let you do it?
I know that you despise this Saiyan, right?
Go ahead and show your loyalty to me,
like you did so long ago.
I will then spare you, at least.
Vegeta!
You keep quiet!
N-Now I've done it...
Whis just barely warned you about this, right?
This is what makes you such an idiot.
I appreciate it, but I can't.
As aggravating as this bastard is,
I need him alive to make me stronger.
I can't afford to kill him.
Then how about this?
I will make you the supreme
commander of the Freeza force.
Then again, right now,
that consists solely of Sorbet,
but we can always increase that later.
What? Supreme commander? You mean that?
Page 27/30
Why, of course I do.
Damn, now I'm going to regret this.
Huh?
I've already made up
my mind to utterly annihilate you.
Wh-What did you say?!
There's no way, after you blew up Planet Vegeta,
that I'd have any loyalty to you, is there?
Oh, Beers-sama, you approved of
the destruction of Planet Vegeta, right?
Shh! Keep that quiet!
Hey, Kuririn! Give Kakarrot
a senzu, or he'll die.
O-Okay.
I won't let that happen!
What?!
Hey, Goku! Snap to!
You're lucky someone didn't want his.
Thank you, Vegeta! You saved me!
Hmph. In return, I'm taking
the best part for myself.
Yeah, I know. It's your turn.
Th-There is no way that you can beat me!
That's right. You didn't know, did you?
That I can turn into a
legendary Super Saiyan, too?
I'm sure you're well aware of this,
but I'm not as forgiving
as he is. Say your prayers.
Vegeta, that's pretty big talk,
c-coming from you.
Wh-Why, you...! This is impossible...!
You're finished now.
And don't ever come back to life again!
Same to all of you!
What?!
Uh-oh. Hey, Whis!
Right!
H-How could he do that?!
Th-The earth... The earth...
Vegeta! Trunks! Papa and Mama!
Th-That bastard! He's
taken them all down with him!
Oh, no. Freeza is likely not dead.
Page 28/30
He can survive in the vacuum of space.
Hmm, that's smart thinking.
Damn! What a monster!
The Dragon Balls have been obliterated,
so there's no way to undo this.
D-Damn it...
I-I should have settled things right away.
Then, would you like to settle things?
Huh?
You brought this on yourself
because of your leniency.
Send Freeza back to his flower garden.
Wh-What do you mean?
All right, I will now turn back time.
We must hurry.
Three minutes is my limit, after all.
Huh? Y-You don't mean...
Yes. A do-over.
Wh-Why, you...! This is impossible...!
You're finished now.
And don't ever come back to life again!
Same to all of you!
Freeza 1!
Wh-What?!
Hal!
Wh-Wha--?!
D-Damn it all!!
Whew, we're saved.
Kakarrot! What did you do?!
N-No, Vegeta! I'm sorry,
I'm sorry! I can explain!
I don't care what you can explain!
You said it was my turn!
It's all right, Vegeta!
Son-kun just saved you and the whole earth!
He what? What does she mean? Tell me!
--Father, we were really worried about you!
--Man, we're really glad you were here. Thanks.
Well, well, what a sorry tale.
I mean, a Destroyer, bringing a planet back.
I will get a huge feast
ready for the two of you.
Once we put Metro North back
with the Dragon Balls, that is.
I look forward to it.
That is the reason why I turned back time.
Are you sure you don't want to arrest him?
Time control is a serious crime, right?
I didn't see anything.
What? I'm not going to thank you.
We're even, after all.
It ain't that, Vegeta.
If we had teamed up from
the start, like Whis-san said,
we never would have gotten in such a tight spot.
Do you think we should
pair together once in a while?
Hmph, I'll still never do that.
Terrific! Me, neither!
Heh, for the first time, we agree on something.
Welcome home!
No!!

FADE IN:
EXT. MOUNT PAOZU - MORNING
The sun rises over Mount Paozu. AERIAL SHOT Whizzes past
the picture postcard perfect Mountain to --
EXT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - MORNING
--A quaint little farmhouse on the side of the mountain.
There is a large field of crops. And a stone courtyard
surrounded by beautifully trimmed bonsai trees.
Meet -- GRANDPA GOHAN (80’s) a sprightly old fellow with
kind, wise eyes. Gohan is in the courtyard doing
intricate martial arts moves with a RED BOWSTAFF. Despite
his age, Gohan is a powerful martial artist.
The door to the cottage opens and -- a handsome, SPIKY
HAIR’D KID with a strong athletic build strolls out --
The kid wears a WHITE Monks outfit with leggings. (Think
Monks robes designed by Sean John.) MEET GOKU (17+) years
old.
GRANDPA GOHAN
Are you ready to practice Goku?
GOKU
Well I was hoping that we could take a
break from...
GRANDPA GOHAN
NO TIME FOR TALK! -- FIGHT!
SWOOSH!
GOHAN SWINGS HIS BOWSTAFF AT GOKU’S HEAD! Instinctively
Goku ducks and then lashes out with a blinding
combination of moves that Gohan is barely able to evade.
The level of the battle becomes more and more intense.
Goku’s skills are beyond phenomenal, bordering on
supernatural.
GOHAN KICKS A BOULDER 4 FEET IN DIAMETER IN THE AIR. He
spins and KICKS IT IN GOKU’S DIRECTION.
GOKU PUNCHES THE BOULDER WITH A FIST PULVERIZING IT INTO
LITTLE PIECES.
The fight moves over to AN OBSTACLE COURSE OF SORTS. A
MYRIAD OF WOODEN POSTS of different heights and
circumferences.
GOKU AND GOHAN leap on the LOWEST WIDEST posts. Gohan
attacks Goku with the bowstaff. Goku ducks and evades
then HOPS TO A HIGHER NARROWER POST.
GOHAN FOLLOWS, upping the intensity of the attack. GOKU,
DUCKS, EVADES, ATTACKS then LEAPS HIGHER. The higher they
go, the narrower the posts get.
GOHAN WHACKS THE POST THAT GOKU STANDS ON. It begins to
ROCK AND SWAY. Goku wobbles fighting to keep his balance.
GRANDPA GOHAN (CONT’D)
HIGHER!
GOKU LEAPS TO THE TALLEST NARROWEST POST some 40 feet
from the ground. He is fighting to keep his balance even
before Gohan attacks.
GOHAN LASHES OUT AT GOKU with the most intense volley of
attacks. GOHAN ATTACKS WITH AN INTENSITY THAT FRIGHTENS
GOKU. Then --
WHACK!
GOHAN STRIKES THE POST and--
GOKU LOSES BALANCE AND FALLS 40 FEET TO THE GROUND.
GOKU
AHHHHHHHHHH!
C’CRACK!
HE HITS THE GROUND SMACKING HIS HEAD PAINFULLY ON A
BOULDER. A second later.
Gohan stands over the fallen boy holding his bowstaff.
Goku rises from the ground rubbing is sore head. We see
that THE BOULDER HE HIT HAS BEEN SHATTERED BY THE BLOW.
GRANDPA GOHAN
What did you do wrong?
GOKU
My White Crane technique was off balance.
GRANDPA GOHAN
All your techniques were off balance.
Goku lowers his head.
GOKU
I know.
GRANDPA GOHAN
And what is the pinnacle of martial arts
excellence?
2.
GOKU
To achieve SUPREME BALANCE.
GRANDPA GOHAN
How do you achieve supreme balance?
GOKU
To understand the balance of time.
GRANDPA GOHAN
And how do you begin to understand the
balance of time?
Goku thinks about it. He’s stumped.
GOKU
I don’t know? Tell me Grandpa.
GRANDPA GOHAN
I cannot tell you because it cannot be
taught. It can only be understood. And
that will come with time but when you do
understand it, you will be faster and
stronger than anyone or anything in the
universe.
Goku eyes Gohan’s bowstaff.
GOKU
When can I practice with the powerpole?
GRANDPA GOHAN
In time.
GOKU
It’s always about time. Why can’t I learn
things now?
GRANDPA GOHAN
(laughing)
Don’t be too eager to learn everything
right away. There are some things out
there that you’re not ready to know
about. You’d better get to school.
OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE:
DRAGONBALL
WE HEAR: THE VOICE OF -- A NARRATOR, his voice ripe with
exaggerated importance. (THINK LEONARD NIMOY or ROBERT
STACK.)
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Long, long ago in the time of the great
eclipse, before history was lost -- our
world was a very different place.
3.
FADE IN:
ON A TV MONITOR.
PIXELATED IMAGES FILL THE FRAME.
We are watching a “KEN BURNS-LIKE” EDUCATIONAL
DOCUMENTARY. Scratchy newsreel type video, Old
photographs, artists renditions and the like give visuals
to the fantastic yarn being told.
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
This is our planet today.
We see clean video footage of a BLUE EARTH-LIKE PLANET.
FUTURISTIC SPACECRAFT WHIZ PAST. Is it Earth? The
landmasses are completely different. It’s as if the Asian
continent were JAMMED INTO NORTH AMERICA.
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
But this -- is what the planet probably
looked like IN THE 21st Century!
The video dissolves to -- AN ARTIST’S RENDITION OF -- THE
PLANET EARTH -- AS WE KNOW IT NOW. The title of the
Documentary comes up “MYTHOLOGY TODAY.”
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
How did our planet change so drastically?
Science tells us of the natural shifting
of tectonic plates. But popular mythology
speaks of something more fantastic.
A DRAMATIC FRANCISCO GOYA-LIKE PAINTING -- A HUMANOID
ALIEN IN A WHITE TURBAN AND FLOWING WHITE CAPE. CHEESY
DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS.
NARRATOR
Strange creatures who landed on our
planet in search of the seven mystical
orbs of power.
An artists rendition of SEVEN GRAPEFRUIT SIZED SPHERES
with five point stars numbering from one to seven painted
on them.
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
DRAGONBALLS. As legend had it, once all
seven Dragonballs were gathered a
magical...
A VERY COMIC BOOKISH DRAWING OF A DRAGON RISING FROM AN
ANCIENT TEMPLE.
4.
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
...DRAGON would emerge and grant the
gatherer a single wish. For the invaders,
led by their leader, Piccolo wished to
dominate the universe and the Dragonballs
were the key.
As the documentary plays camera PULLS BACK to reveal -- A
DARKENED CLASSROOM.
INT. MOUNT PAOZU HIGH - HISTORY CLASS - DAY
BORED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS sit at desks watching the
documentary. Some are snoozing.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
But the Dragonballs had protectors. SEVEN
GREAT MASTERS with mystical powers.
ON SCREEN WE SEE: An artists depiction of SEVEN GREAT
MASTERS. They are of all different races. Some younger.
Some older. They all wear ORANGE SHAOLIN STYLE MONK SUITS
with WHITE LEG WRAPS. The outfits look very similar to
Goku’s.
CAMERA TRACKS TO --
Goku as he stares dreamily at --
KIRA PALU - A CUTE BLOND GIRL sitting in the next row.
She is oblivious to his adoring gaze.
THE VIDEO IS TURNED OFF AND THE LIGHTS COME UP.
END TITLE SEQUENCE:
THE TEACHER, a droll passionless man with a flat
sarcastic voice, begins to query the class on what they
just saw.
TEACHER
So, can anyone tell me why this myth that
a Demon from outer space was responsible
for the destruction of the world still
persists?
(beat)
Anyone?
(beat)
How about you...
SLAM! He smacks his pointer on Goku’s desk, snapping Goku
out of his romantic haze.
TEACHER (CONT’D)
...Goku.
5.
Goku is taken off guard.
GOKU
Huh?... What did you say?
TEACHER
If you were paying attention to me
instead of Ms. Palu over there, you would
have known.
Everyone in the class laughs. Goku turns red with
embarrassment.
TEACHER (CONT’D)
The question was... Why does this myth
that a demon from outer space destroyed
the planet still persists in this day and
age.
GOKU
Well, technically it wasn’t actually the
demon Piccolo who destroyed the Earth. It
was Oozaru the Destroyer that did the
actual destroying. And they weren’t from
outer space they were from the planet
Namek.
TEACHER
(patronizing)
You don’t say.
Goku launches into his explanation with the zeal of a
Trekkie extolling the virtue of “THE NEXT GENERATION”
over “DEEP SPACE NINE.”
GOKU
Yeah, see, Piccolo was unable to defeat
the Seven Great masters on his own. So he
summoned Oozaru, the beast he had sent to
Earth to hide amongst the humans. So,
when Oozaru began to decimate the planet
with these powerful blasts of dark energy
summoned from the newly eclipsed sun...
The Masters could no longer focus their
attention on Piccolo and that in
essence...
Goku looks around at the teacher and his classmates
staring at him. He realizes that he is rambling on like a
geek.
GOKU (CONT’D)
...was... their... downfall.
A moment of silence. Then a student blurts out from the
back of the class.
6.
RUDE STUDENT
DORK!
The classroom bursts into laughter. Goku lowers his head
in shame. Kira Palu turns and notices Goku for the first
time. She laughs at him but it’s kinda of a sweet laugh.
TEACHER
(to the class)
Okay settle down now.
(to Goku)
That was a great explanation of how the
Earth was destroyed in this mythological
tale. But the question was Why... this
mythology still persists.
GOKU
I don’t know.
TEACHER
The reason these myths exist is because
of fear -- That’s right, fear. You see,
much of history was lost in the cataclysm
of the 21st Century. Civilizations were
lost. Millions upon millions of people
died. And science has no solid answers as
to why. The popular belief being that the
gravitational pull of the sun and the
moon caused the shifting of tectonic
plates. Now we are facing the same solar
eclipse that precluded the end of the
world 2000 years ago, people are afraid.
The fear is not so much that they will
die. The fear is that they will die
because of something as random and
unromantic as a freak natural disaster.
No, these people want drama in their
lives and in their deaths.
The Teacher walks over and stares at Goku.
TEACHER (CONT’D)
This -- Dragonball fantasy of evil
Demons, virtuous warriors and magical
Dragons is nothing more than a fairy tale
embraced by lost souls who want to make
their otherwise insignificant lives
significant.
CUT TO:
7.
INT. MOUNT PAOZU HIGH - HALLWAYS - DAY
The bell rings and students swarm into the halls. With
the exception of a few “NEXT GENERATION” looking vending
machines. And a couple of ANTI-GRAVITY SKATEBOARDERS
whizzing by, this high school of the future looks pretty
much like any High School we’ve ever seen. The fashion is
kind of a futuristic Phat Farm.
Goku strolls down the hallway slinging his backpack on.
He sticks out like a sore thumb in his monks outfit. A
COUPLE OF JOCKS stroll past. The biggest one JOHNNY
FRANK, plucks at Goku’s robe.
JOHNNY FRANK
Nice suit, Piccolo!
GOKU
This is a great master suit, not...
SLAM! Johnny pushes Goku into the lockers. The jocks
stroll off laughing. Goku glares at the jock. He balls
his fist so tight that his knuckles crack. Then --
GOKU (CONT’D)
(thinking out loud)
Not allowed to fight. Thanks Grandpa.
He slowly un-balls his fist. Goku looks around --
SLOW MOTION
The hallway is teaming with happy good looking kids all
paired off into attractive well adjusted cliques. Goku
looks at his weird Monks robe. It’s clear that he feels
isolated.
NORMAL SPEED
A second later Goku is flanked by TWO NERDY LOOKING BOYS
who also wear MONKS SUITS. These are Goku’s best friends.
KAL AND WULAN. Three misfits in a sea of normalcy.
WULAN
Dude, I heard you got reamed in History
class today.
GOKU
I don’t want to talk about it.
Kal pulls out TWO PLASTIC PROTECTED DRAGONBALL TRADING
CARDS.
8.
KAL
Check it Goku. I totally scored man. I
got both the Nameless and the
Archeologist trading cards.
GOKU
(detached)
Good for you.
Kal is shocked at Goku’s lack of enthusiasm. He shoves
the cards in Goku’s face.
INSERT CARDS
We see the image of THE NAMELESS. A HOODED DARK ROBED
FIGURE WITH HIS FACE OBSCURED BY SHADOW. ON HIS CHEST IS
AN ORNATE TATTOO.
Then we see the image of THE ARCHEOLOGIST. A HANDSOME
INDIANA JONES TYPE in wire framed glasses.
KAL
(righteous indignation)
Dude! I’m talking about The Nameless...
Only the greatest of the Great Masters!
The master of the Kamehameha wave.
WULAN
The most powerful move in all martial
arts.
BACK TO SCENE
Goku spies Kira Palu at her locker struggling to get it
open. Goku sees an opportunity.
GOKU
(staring at Kira)
Yeah whatever.
Goku gathers his nerves and approaches Kira. His friends
shake their heads sadly.
GOKU (CONT’D)
Hey, can I help you with that?
KIRA
Yeah, thanks. I think it’s stuck.
Goku fiddles with the locker then CACHUNK! It opens.
KIRA (CONT’D)
Thanks Goku. You’re a life saver.
9.
GOKU
I have the same problem with my locker
too. You know the mechanism gets all...
stuck... n’all.
KIRA
Yeah I hate that.
GOKU
It sucks...
There is an awkward silence as the two stare at each
other kind of half smiling. Then --
KIRA
Well... gotta go.
She turns and walks away. Goku winces as he watches her
walk away. A missed opportunity.
GOKU
(to himself)
Why didn’t you get her number.
Then Kira turns around and looks at Goku.
KIRA
I’m having a party at my house this
weekend.
Goku lights up like a Christmas tree.
GOKU
(grinning ear to ear)
I’ll be there.
Kal and Wulan stroll up to Goku staring at him in awe.
WULAN
Dude what are you doing? That’s Kira
Palu. She’s like totally out of your
league.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WULAN’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - EVENING
Goku, Kal and Wulan sit at a LARGE FLAT SCREEN MONITOR
playing a video game called. -- DRAGONBALL - LAIR OF THE
ETERNAL DRAGON.
Goku maneuvers his character THE ARCHEOLOGIST through the
maze-like corridors of the ancient temple.
10.
Goku makes his character leap and jump over traps,
avoiding blades that spring out of walls, hopping over
trap doors cleverly disguised as floor tiles, RUNNING UP
THE SIDE OF WALLS to avoid collapsible floors. Then --
HE FALLS THROUGH A TRAPDOOR. And his character slides
down a winding shaft --
KAL
(to Goku)
Dude, you just fell into a trap. You’re
sliding down the shaft to the sacrificial
chamber. You’re dead.
GOKU
Not if I can...
Goku makes the character stand up as he slides, then at
the last minute -- HE JUMPS does a FRONT somersault in
the air and -- SHLAACK! -- IS IMPALED by one of A HUNDRED
POINTED SPIKES. He’s dead.
KAL
Told you. There’s only one way to survive
the sacrificial chamber slide. You count
15 perfect seconds from the second turn.
It’s got to be 15 perfect seconds, then
BACK SOMERSAULT, and you’ll survive. Here
let me show you.
Kal resets the game. He makes the character slide down
the shaft. Counts a perfect 15 seconds then WHOOSH BACK
SOMERSAULTS and THUMP! Survives the landing.
KAL (CONT’D)
Only downside is there is no escape from
the sacrificial chamber.
WULAN
What’s with you Goku? You never fell for
that trap before. You’re the Dragon’s
Lair master. What’s on your mind?
GOKU
I think I’m gonna go to Kira’s party this
weekend.
KAL
You can’t go. This weekend’s your
birthday party. That’s when we have our
killer Dragonball party in celebration?
GOKU
Yeah, so what?
WULAN
What? Dude you’re not seriously thinking
about breaking the tradition?
11.
(MORE)
On your birthday Grandpa Gohan always
throws you a Dragonball party. We play
Dragonball. Then you show us some new
killer moves.
Wulan does some awkward martial arts techniques.
GOKU
C’mon guys do you really think that three
18 year old dudes, and an old man sitting
around eating cake and playing Dragonball
is better than going to a real party with
real girls?
Kal and Wulan enthusiastically nod yes.
KAL AND WULAN
ABSOLUTELY!
Goku shuts the TV off.
GOKU
For once I’d like to go to a real party.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - FIELDS - DAY
Goku and Gohan climb on a futuristic looking tractor.
Despite it’s high-tech design it is FILTHY AND BEAT-UP.
It looks like it’s being held together by chewing gum. It
putters off into the fields.
Goku seems pensive.
GOKU
Grandpa?
GRANDPA GOHAN
Yes.
GOKU
Well, tomorrow’s my birthday.
GRANDPA GOHAN
Yes, your eighteenth. A big day.
GOKU
There’s gonna be this...party, in
Shippingport that night. I was wondering
if I could go.
GRANDPA GOHAN
(cutting him off)
I already have your birthday planned. In
the morning, we do chores.
12.
WULAN (CONT'D)
(MORE)
In the afternoon, I introduce you to a
new technique. Then in the evening Kal
and Wulan will come over a we’ll play
Dragonball.
Goku is pissed.
GOKU
Play Dragonball... Do Chores... train?
Learning new techniques are my birthday
present? What am I training for?
(fuming)
YOU NEVER LET ME FIGHT! Some jerk pushed
me in school yesterday. I could have
flattened him with one finger.
GRANDPA GOHAN
You are not training to fight students in
high school.
GOKU
Then who am I training to fight?
GRANDPA GOHAN
You will know when the time is right.
Goku flies off in a teenage, raging hormone, induced
huff!
GOKU
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT! When is the time
gonna be right for me to HAVE A LIFE?
It’s always Goku, you have to train.
Goku, it’s time to do the chores. The
only fun you let me have is playing
Dragonball with the only two kids in
school weirder than me! Why can’t I be
like the other kids?
GRANDPA GOHAN
Because you’re not like the other kids,
Goku, you’re special.
GOKU
I’M TIRED OF BEING SPECIAL. I WANT TO BE
NORMAL!
Goku grabs a bushel basket and heads off into the field,
harvesting the odd vegetables growing. His anger turns to
sadness.
GOKU (CONT’D)
Oh what’s the use? The way things are
going, I’m gonna be king dork for the
rest of my life.
Gohan looks at the sullen teen dutifully doing his
chores. Gohan can’t help but feel sorry for Goku.
13.
GRANDPA GOHAN (CONT'D)
Gohan reaches into the back of the tractor and pulls out
A PACKAGE WRAPPED IN BROWN PAPER. He walks over and hands
it to Goku.
GRANDPA GOHAN
I was going to wait until tomorrow to
give this to you but I figured you could
use some cheering up now. Happy birthday
Goku.
Goku unenthusiastically unwraps the package. Revealing. A
VERY COOL ORANGE MONKS OUTFIT. Goku looks at the robe in
disgust.
GRANDPA GOHAN (CONT’D)
It’s the suit of a Great Master. A
protector of the Dragonballs.
GOKU
(sarcastic)
Oh, great. Just what I need.
Goku turns and walks away leaving the orange outfit
sitting on the tractor. Gohan stares sadly at Goku then --
UP AT THE SKY.
The sun is beginning to set over Mount Paozu. The view is
nothing short of breathtaking. The sun is setting and the
moon is rising. They are alarmingly close. An eclipse is
drawing near.
CUT TO:
EXT. WEST CITY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
In stark contrast to the quaint countryside that Goku
lives in. West City is a SPRAWLING METROPOLIS as big as
the state of Rhode Island. A place of amazing technology.
Skywalks and moving sidewalks link towering skyscrapers
some over a MILE IN HEIGHT. ADVERTISING SEEMS TO BE
FESTOONED EVERYWHERE.
EXT. THE CAPSULE CORPORATION - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
The building is TITANIC, nearly A MILE IN HEIGHT. It’s so
high that the top of the building DISAPPEARS IN THE
CLOUDS.
INT. THE CAPSULE CORPORATION - NIGHT
Most of the building is dark. LIGHTING FROM OUTSIDE
shines in through the large plate glass windows giving
the corridors and eerie almost CATHEDRAL like effect.
14.
A DARK FEMALE INTRUDER
(20’s) beautiful in an evil sort of way, steals through
the corridors ducking in and out of the SHAFTS OF LIGHT
like a wraith. She makes her way into --
INT. THE CAPSULE CORPORATION - LAB 1 - CONTINUOUS
A HIGH TECH LABORATORY festooned with stainless steel
equipment blinking multicolored lights. In the center of
a glass chamber sits -- A GLOWING SPHERE OF SOME SORT. It
glows because it is being bombarded with several RED
LASER BEAMS. To the side of it sits a small HAND-HELD
DEVICE labelled DBE-LOCATOR PROTOTYPE. An evil smile
crosses The Intruder’s face.
CUT TO:
INT. THE CAPSULE CORPORATION - LAB 2 - SAME
A FEMALE SCIENTIST sits with her back to us. Her face is
buried in an electron microscope. Her fingers tap away at
a keypad. A myriad of equations stream across scores of
flat monitors. On TV the financial report is on.
TV NEWSCASTER
And in financial news, stock in the once
unstoppable Capsule Corporation continues
to plummet. Word of a possible take
over...
FEMALE SCIENTIST
Oh, shut up!
The Scientist shuts the TV off. Suddenly --
AN ALARM GOES OFF.
The young scientist turns and we see her face for the
first time. She’s gorgeous. Meet BULMA BRIEFS (20) a
beautiful young scientific genius with attitude to spare.
BULMA
What the...!
She leaps out of her chair and rushes into --
INT. THE CAPSULE CORPORATION - LAB 1 - CONTINUOUS
She sees the glass container that held the Sphere. ONLY
the glass has been cut open as if by some powerful heat
source. And THE SPHERE IS GONE. Bulma Freaks!
15.
BULMA
Oh no, no, no, no....
She looks to where the hand-held device was. IT’S GONE!
BULMA (CONT’D)
...NO!
Suddenly something catches her attention from the corner
of her eye. A SHADOWY BLUR. -- THE INTRUDER bolts out of
the shadows and through the door.
All Bulma catches is her black coat blowing through the
door. Bulma LEAPS INTO ACTION. She SMASHES A GLASS PANE
labelled SECURITY, presses her palm into a PALM READER.
Another door opens and Bulma pulls from it --
A PISTOL
She bolts out of the door in pursuit of the Intruder.
INT. THE CAPSULE CORPORATION - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS
The Intruder disappears around a corner. Bulma turns up
the steam in hot pursuit. POW! POW! POW! She caps off
shots. But the Intruder dodges and weaves gracefully! She
turns and tosses A SHURIKEN THROWING KNIFE!
Bulma SLIDES under the SPINNING BLADE like a baseball
player sliding home. The blade slices clean through A
STEEL PIPE. Bulma caps off several more shots as she
slides. Then --
A PHALANX OF WHITE SUITED SECURITY GUARDS
Round the corner blocking the Intruder’s way. Without
breaking a step, the Intruder RUNS UP THE SIDE OF THE
WALL DEFYING GRAVITY and runs around the stunned guards.
WHAP! PAP! OOOF! WHAP! POW! BOOF!
The Intruder lashes out at the guards with LIGHTNING
QUICK MARTIAL ARTS MOVES. In less than four seconds THE
SECURITY GUARDS FALL TO THE GROUND DEAD OR UNCONSCIOUS.
The Intruder stands behind the downed guards smiling
wickedly. She LICKS HER LIPS SUGGESTIVELY AT BULMA then
darts into the stairwell.
BULMA
OH, NO YOU DON’T!
Bulma is a determined girl. She leaps to her feet and
gives chase darting into the stairwell.
16.
INT. THE CAPSULE CORPORATION - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
The Intruder is several floors above her. Bulma darts up
the stairs like an Olympic sprinter until she finally
reaches --
EXT. THE CAPSULE CORPORATION - ROOFTOP - NIGHT
The Intruder is darting across the great expanse that is
the rooftop. Bulma gives chase.
BULMA
STOP!
The Intruder reaches the edge of the building. Nowhere
else to go but down. She stands on the ledge. Bulma
approaches with her pistol drawn. She approaches
casually.
BULMA (CONT’D)
Hand over my things or I drop you!
The Intruder BLOWS A KISS TO BULMA then -- LEAPS OFF THE
LEDGE to certain death no doubt. Bulma rushes to the
ledge and looks over in time to see --
THE INTRUDER FALL AND DISAPPEAR IN THE LOW CLOUD COVER. A
second later --
WOOSH! A JET-LIKE AIRCRAFT whooshes out of the clouds and
rips past Bulma. THE INTRUDER IS AT THE PILOT’S SEAT. She
waves at Bulma as the craft ROCKETS OFF into the night.
BULMA (CONT’D)
Shit!
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. OPEN SEA - NIGHT
The JET-LIKE AIRCRAFT rockets across the ocean. To what
looks like A STORM AT SEA. A DARK CLOUD STRETCHES FROM
THE SKY TO THE SEA in one unbroken column. FLASHES OF
LIGHTNING periodically illuminate the cloud.
The Aircraft enters the storm cloud and is instantly
buffeted by strong wind and heavy rain. The craft begins
to descend to --
A MASSIVE OIL TANKER
It is as big as FOUR NORMAL OIL TANKERS. It cruises
through the choppy sea.
17.
The name on the side of the ship reads -- GEN-TECH
GENETICS. THE FRONT OF THE TANKER SPLITS OPEN revealing A
LANDING PAD. This is obviously no ordinary Oil Tanker.
The Aircraft flies into the opening and lightly touches
down on the pad.
INT. OIL TANKER - CONTINUOUS
THE FEMALE INTRUDER climbs out of the aircraft holding a
black case containing the stolen booty. She is,
MAI,(20’s) as beautiful as she is psychotically evil.
She makes her way through the grotesquely organic looking
corridors of the Oil Tanker. It is VERY CLEAR NOW that
this is no regular oil tanker. The technology looks like
the entrails of some decayed beast.
Mai’s trek through the tanker is like a stroll through a
ZDZISLAW BEKSINSKI painting. Mai passes A GENETICS LAB.
Large glass tanks of sickly yellow liquid line the walls.
MUTATED HALF/HUMAN HALF/BEAST monstrosities float in the
putrid goo. Mai finally enters
A HUGE DARK ANTECHAMBER.
INT. OIL TANKER - THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
In the middle of the antechamber is a HIGH TECH CONTROLCHAIR. The arm-rests are lined with blinking control
lights. The chair is illuminated by a SOLITARY SHAFT OF
LIGHT and almost seems like a THRONE OF SORTS. The rest
of the massive room falls into shadow.
Sitting on the chair is PILAF, a short diminutive ALBINO
MAN with a bald head CRISSCROSSED BY BLUE VEINS. He
stares out at us with SICKLY PINK EYES. He is flanked by
his bodyguard --
SHOU
A LARGE HEAVILY MUSCLED MAN dressed like a HIGH TECH
NINJA. A hood and mask cover his face.
Mai nods to Pilaf.
PILAF
Did you get it?
MAI
Yes.
Mai opens up a black case. The glowing object illuminates
Pilaf’s face. He smiles wickedly.
Mai holds up the stolen DBE LOCATOR.
18.
MAI (CONT’D)
We can use this to find the rest.
Shou walks over and stands next to Mai. Pilaf nods to
Shou.
SHOU MAKES A MILITARISTIC HAND SIGN.
And as if on cue. THE THUMP, THUMP THUMP of marching feet
is heard. AN ARMY OF HIGH TECH NINJAS dressed much like
SHOU emerge from the darkness of the craft. 50 strong.
On closer inspection we can see that they are a
mechanical/organic mix. These are -- THE HEIJI WARRIORS.
Pilaf looks at his army favorably.
PILAF
Find them all. Kill everything that
stands in your way.
PULL BACK AND UP TO REVEAL THE ENTIRE ANTECHAMBER. It is
designed just like A DRAGONBALL BOARD GAME.
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON --
A DRAGONBALL BOARD-GAME. PULL BACK TO REVEAL
The dining room is decorated for a party. The game sits
next to a big birthday cake on the dinner table. Gohan is
placing the last of eighteen candles in the cake.
GRANDPA GOHAN
Goku! Are you ready, your friends are
going to be here...
Suddenly -- GOHAN IS SHAKEN as if by a jolt of
electricity. He stares wide eyed at us almost as if in a
trance. The match burns his fingers and snaps him out of
his haze. Gohan rushes into --
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - GOHAN’S STUDY
Gohan opens his closet. He slides open a secret panel,
then opens a floor safe. He is enveloped by an orange
glow.
GRANDPA GOHAN
(almost a whisper)
It has begun!
19.
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - GOKU’S ROOM
Gohan enters Goku’s room, urgency in his demeanor.
GRANDPA GOHAN
There is something very important I must
tell you.
NOTHING
GRANDPA GOHAN (CONT’D)
Goku?
It seems that Goku is in bed with the covers pulled over
his head. Gohan pulls the covers back to reveal -- A
BUNDLE A DIRTY CLOTHS. Goku is gone.
Suddenly --
THE FRONT DOORBELL RINGS
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
Gohan opens the door. Kal and Wulan are there.
GRANDPA GOHAN
Boys, do you know where Goku is?
KAL
He’s not here?
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. PAOZU FORREST - EVENING
ON THE ROAD
Goku putters down the road on the rickety tractor. The
dim headlights illuminate the dirt road leading through
the dense forest. He is dressed in normal clothes. Goku
rehearses his pick-up lines.
GOKU
Hey Kira, you look really nice tonight.
(thinks about it)
Wow, Kira you look super hot.
Suddenly -- THE TRACTOR SPUTTERS -- AND DIES. The lights
die and the forest is plunged into COMPLETE DARKNESS.
GOKU (CONT’D)
Oh, no!
20.
Goku jumps off the tractor, opens the hood and starts to
tinker with the engine. Suddenly he hears --
A SNARL
Goku looks up staring around the darkened forest. He sees
nothing. He goes back to working on the tractor. ANOTHER
SNARL. Goku looks up. From the darkness of the
surrounding woods, he sees -- A PAIR OF GLOWING RED
EYES. Then another pair. And another. Before he knows it,
he’s surrounded by -- WOLVES! Goku leaps in a MARTIAL
ARTS STANCE then --
THEY ATTACK.
CUT TO:
EXT. PAOZU FOREST - EVENING
WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT. WE DON’T SEE THE CARNAGE THAT TAKES
PLACE. We just hear it and from the sound of things Goku
must be getting slaughtered.
BACK TO SCENE
When we return to the forest we see GOKU standing
surrounded by SCORES OF DEAD WOLVES. His clothes are
dirty and tattered. He takes a furtive glance at the old
tractor -- dead. He heads off down the road on foot.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PAOZU VILLAGE - NIGHT
THE QUAINT LITTLE VILLAGE OF PAOZU VILLAGE is a peaceful
little upper middle class town. AN OLD ORNATE CHURCH is
the centerpiece of the village.
Goku arrives at Kira’s house to find -- THE PARTY IS
OVER. Kids are hanging out in the front yard. Smoking,
some of them are making out. Some are paired off and
driving away in cool futuristic cars and pick-up trucks.
A group of girls walk past Goku. He addresses them.
GOKU
Hey have you seen Kira?
TEEN GIRL
She’s over there.
The girl points to the large Oak tree in the front yard.
He can see the back of Kira’s head poking out from behind
the tree. Goku approaches.
21.
He walks over to the tree nervous. He silently rehearses
his pick-up line. He walks around the tree to find -
KIRA LOCKED IN A DEEP OPEN MOUTH KISS WITH --
JOHNNY FRANK!
Goku is crushed. Johnny notices him, eyeing Goku’s
tattered clothes.
JOCK
Hey, it’s Piccolo! Nice outfit man!
Kira is still in a Jock induced romantic haze she doesn’t
even notice Goku. They return to sucking each others
tonsils out. Goku turns and walks away dejected. Then to
make matters worse --
IT STARTS TO RAIN. All the kids pair off, get into cars
and drive away leaving Goku alone. WHAT A TERRIBLE NIGHT.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PAOZU FORREST - NIGHT
During the walk home the rain stops and THE CLOUDS CLEAR.
A FULL MOON fills the sky. Goku reaches his broken
tractor. He is exhausted. He sits down by one of the
large wheels.
GOKU
Just a short rest and I’ll be on my...
And before he knows it. Goku has fallen sound asleep.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PAOZU FOREST - LATER
Goku has been asleep for some time now. As he sleeps.
Goku tosses and turns. He is having a nightmare. We see
his eyes flutter behind closed lids. It’s a bad one.
FWOOSH!
DREAM SEQUENCE:
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - NIGHT
WE SEE HIS NIGHTMARE IN SHATTERED IMAGES. Grandpa Gohan
battles with SOME KIND OF FURRY FANGED MAN-LIKE CREATURE.
It is a fight to the death. The creature rears back to
deliver a death blow then --
22.
BLACKOUT
EXT. PAOZU FORREST - MORNING
Goku wakes up. The morning sun is just starting to rise
over the horizon. Goku looks like he feels.
GOKU
(full of regret)
I’m gonna get it.
He heads home.
EXT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - MORNING
When Goku arrives home he is horrified to see THE
BEAUTIFUL COTTAGE AND COURTYARD in shambles. The cottage
itself is half burned down.
GOKU
GRANDPA!
He rushes into the smoldering cottage kicking debris out
of his way.
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - MORNING
He almost trips over --
THE BURNT SMOLDERING CORPSES OF KAL AND WULAN.
GOKU
OH, MY GOD! NO!
Goku kneels down by the corpses of his two friends. Tears
well in his eyes. No time to mourn. Gotta find Grandpa.
He looks around frantically.
GOKU (CONT’D)
GRAAAAANNNNPAAAAA!
A NOISE. A choking gurgling noise, coming from Gohan’s
study.
GOKU (CONT’D)
GRANDPAAAAA!
He rushes into the study to find --
23.
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - GOHAN’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS
Gohan laying on his back beaten and bloody. He gasps for
breath like a beached fish. Goku rushes to his side
kneeling down by him.
GOKU
Grandpa, what happened?
GRANDPA GOHAN
I...was attacked.
GOKU
You wait here I’ll go find a doctor!
Gohan takes Goku’s hand in his bloody hand and pulls him
back.
GRANDPA GOHAN
No... It’s too late for me.
Tears start to well in Goku’s eyes.
GOKU
Grandpa no.
GRANDPA GOHAN
 Come closer son...
Goku leans closer.
GOKU
Grandpa I’m so sorry, I disobeyed you I
went to the party and, I broke the
tractor and, and...
Gohan smiles he reaches up and touches Goku’s face.
GRANDPA GOHAN
Shhhhh, it’s okay, Grandson I forgive
you. But that’s not important now.
He grabs Goku and places a bloody object in his hands. IT
IS A DRAGONBALL. A REAL LIFE DRAGONBALL. Gohan is
starting to fade. In broken gasps Gohan tells Goku.
GRANDPA GOHAN (CONT’D)
The Namek-Jins have returned. They have a
Dragonball. Find Master Roshi, my master,
my teacher -- The last of the great
masters.
Gohan breaks into a coughing fit, spitting up blood as he
does. He’s dying. There’s not much life in him. With his
last breath he says --
24.
GRANDPA GOHAN (CONT'D)
Go to Paozu Village... The old priest
will tell you how to find Roshi. But...
beware... When Dragonballs fall into the
hands of evil, unwholesome things rise
from the Earth.
(gasps for breath)
Must stop them before... Eclipse...
And with that -- GRANDPA GOHAN DIES. Goku opens his mouth
to scream out his grief but no sound comes out.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - DUSK
As the sun sets over the smoldering wreckage of Goku’s
former life. He finishes covering Gohan, Kal and Wulan’s
graves with dirt. Over Kal’s grave he sets the NAMELESS
COLLECTOR’S CARD. Over Wulan’s he sets THE ARCHEOLOGIST
CARD. Over Gohan’s grave, he does a graceful Tai Chi form
then bows.
GOKU
I will avenge you.
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - DAY
Goku reaches into what’s left of his closet and pulls out
-- THE ORANGE MONKS SUIT that Gohan gave him for his
birthday. He puts it on like Superman donning his
supersuit for the first time.
EXT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - DAY
Goku emerges from the cottage in FULL DRAGONBALL
SPLENDOR. Afterwards he collects A BAG OF SUPPLIES and
HIS GRANDFATHER’S POWERPOLE and heads off into the woods
to his destiny.
SUPER: THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE ECLIPSE.
FADE OUT/IN:
EXT. PAOZU FORREST - DAY
ONCE AGAIN GOKU is back on that familiar road. He passes
his wrecked tractor. He heads on and -- HEARS A NOISE. A
RUSTLING IN THE WOODS getting closer. Wolves again?
25.
Goku drops into a fighting stance with powerpole in hand.
Suddenly --
BRIGHT LIGHTS! BLINDING! COMING RIGHT FOR HIM!
He leaps out of the way just in time as --
A TRUCK. A HIGH TECH LABORATORY ON WHEELS.
HOOKSLIDES and swerves wildly and TIPS OVER AND SMACKS
AGAINST A TREE. The door opens. A young woman pulls
herself from the broken vehicle. Goku stares wide eyed at --
BULMA
She jumps out of the vehicle. She’s gorgeous. Goku is
instantly smitten.
BULMA
What are you crazy? Standing in the
middle of the road like that? You trying
to get yourself killed?
GOKU
No.
Bulma inspects her busted vehicle just a few yards from
Goku’s busted vehicle. She’s pissed.
BULMA
Oh, great! Look what you did to my RV! A
one of a kind state of the art fusion
reactor research vehicle totalled.
GOKU
Sorry.
BULMA
Now what am I gonna do? I was on my way
to...
(she thinks about something)
Hey wait a minute. Don’t go anywhere.
She climbs back into the vehicle and returns with A DBE
LOCATOR. The exact same kind as the one stolen by Mai
several days ago. She flips it on
INSERT LOCATOR
THERE IS A FLASHING BLIP DEAD CENTER IN THE SCREEN.
BULMA (CONT’D)
(excited)
You have a Dragonball!
Goku clutches his backpack defensively.
26.
GOKU
(lying badly)
Naw, not me.
BULMA
Come off of it man, you have one.
GOKU
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
BULMA
(smirking)
Yeah you do.
GOKU
How do you know what I have?
Bulma holds up the locator.
BULMA
(in one breath)
Because what I have here is a Capsule
PSI128 DBE LOCATOR. Designed by myself, I
might add, that can lock onto the unique
energy pattern put out by one of only
seven objects in the entire world that
emit such an energy pattern. It is 100
percent accurate within a range of 10
thousand kilometers. And according to
this Locator there is one right in that
ugly back pack of yours.
GOKU
You’re wrong.
BULMA
I’ll pay you 1000 RMB for it.
GOKU
IT’S NOT FOR SALE!
Bulma points at him triumphant.
BULMA
AH HA! SO YOU DO HAVE ONE!
GOKU
Okay I have a Dragonball. But you’re not
getting it.
BULMA
Why not? What’s it to you?
GOKU
I am it’s sworn protector.
27.
BULMA
(flippant)
Uh, yeah... And you’re protecting it from
-- who?
GOKU
(grave earnestness)
The Namek-Jins.
Bulma rolls her eyes. She stares slack jawed at Goku. Her
expression says “You gotta be kidding me.”
BULMA
Oh, God, you’re one of those Dragonball
geeks. You know that it’s a fairy tale?
GOKU
That’s what I thought too. But now I know
that it’s true.
BULMA
And who told you that it was true?
GOKU
My Grandfather.
BULMA
You sure he doesn’t suffer from dementia
or anything like that?
GOKU
(pissed)
MY GRANDPA IS DEAD!
Silence. Bulma realizes that she said the wrong thing.
BULMA
(softening)
I’m sorry. Look, I think we got off on
the wrong foot. What’s your name?
GOKU
My name is Goku.
BULMA
I’m Bulma.
Silence. A slight smile crosses Goku’s face. Then a
guffaw. He fights not to laugh. Bulma’s pissed.
BULMA (CONT’D)
Okay, I know you’re not laughing at my
name
(sarcastic)
KOGO!
28.
GOKU
It’s Goku and no I’m not. Bulma is a --
nice name.
BULMA
Damn right it is. Let’s make a deal. You
are the --
(makes quote fingers)
 -- protector -- of the Dragonballs. I’m
looking for them. Two days ago some crazy
bitch broke into my Daddy’s company and
stole the one that I had and she killed
three people doing so. So there are
obviously bad individuals out there
looking for Dragonballs and they have one
of these too.
(holds up the locator)
So, if you’re gonna protect the
Dragonballs from the bad guys you’re
gonna need my help. I’ll find them and
you can protect them. Whadaya say? Do we
have a deal.
Bulma reaches out her hand. Goku looks at it for a
moment.
GOKU
How do I know you’re not evil?
Bulma puts a hand on her hip and cops a “hottie pose.”
BULMA
Do I look evil?
GOKU
(admiring the view)
No, you don’t.
They shake hands.
GOKU (CONT’D)
Deal.
BULMA
So what’s the plan, GoGo?
GOKU
I have to find master Roshi. He’s the
last of the Great Masters. He’ll know
what to do.
BULMA
(patronizing)
Hmmm, good plan.
SMASH CUT TO:

INT. MAI’S AIRCRAFT - SAME
The JET ROCKETS ACROSS THE SKY. A dense forest is below.
Mai looks at the LOCATOR. There is -- A SIGNAL. TWO
DRAGONBALLS. The map on the locator shows that ONE is in
PAOZU FOREST. The other is in PAOZU VILLAGE.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. PAOZU FORREST - SAME
Goku helps Bulma pull equipment from the RV. She pulls
out A SILVER CASE with an LCD readout on it.
BULMA
Listen. If that bitch manages to get that
other locator working they’re gonna be
able to trace this ball. So I suggest we
put it in this case. It blocks the energy
signature.
Goku is hesitant.
BULMA (CONT’D)
You can carry the case.
GOKU
Okay.
Goku trusts Bulma and lets her put his ball in the case.
She closes the case and --
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. MAI’S AIRCRAFT - SAME
THE BLIP from PAOZU FOREST disappears. The one in Paozu
Village remains. Mai BANKS THE AIRCRAFT and heads for
Paozu Village.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. PAOZU FORREST - EARLY EVENING
Bulma and Goku are finished pulling equipment from the
RV. Bulma produces A SHINY CHROME CAPSULE about the size
of an eggplant. She presses a button on the side of the
capsule and it morphs into THE COOLEST DAMN MOTORCYCLE
YOU’VE EVER SCENE.
30.
GOKU
(admiring the bike)
Wicked.
They fasten the equipment on the bike. Bulma gets on and
REVS IT UP. Goku gets on behind her.
BULMA
Hold on.
Goku wraps his arms around her waist. Hmmm, kinda cozy.
Kinda sexy. Then -- ZOOOOOM! They pull off so fast Goku
almost gets whiplash.
EXT. PAOZU FORREST - MOTORCYCE - EVENING
Bulma drives like a mad woman. But she’s perfectly calm.
Goku on the other hand is kinda nervous.
GOKU
So, why are you collecting Dragonballs?
BULMA
Well my father found the first one during
an archeological dig in the Northern
Territories. He discovered that it
emitted an as yet unknown source of
energy. He felt that if that energy could
be harnessed it would be a revolutionary
new power source. It would be worth
billions and we would own the patent and
corner the market in power and energy. So
I’m just following in my father’s
footsteps.
GOKU
What happened to your father?
BULMA
I don’t talk about it.
GOKU
Why not?
BULMA
It’s in the past.
THEY GO AIRBORNE LEAPING OVER A HILL and land with a
bounce. Bulma doesn’t blink an eyelash.
GOKU
So you’re a scientist?
BULMA
Yep. Damn good one too.
31.
GOKU
My Grandpa says that scientists are like
rock stars nowadays. He says they’re not
in it for knowledge like they were back
in the old days. He says they’re in it
for money and fame.
BULMA
Duh! Why even go into science unless
you’re interested in money and fame.
VRRRROOOMMM! The bike tears off down the road. AS THE SUN
SETS ON THE HORIZON.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. PAOZU VILLAGE - NIGHT
A SHOPKEEPER closes his general store for the evening. He
locks the door then notices NOISES. Light scurrying
noises. Then he sees something.
SHOPKEEPER
Hey, what the...
A BLINDING QUICK FLASH OF METAL.
SWISH! SLASH!
The shopkeeper falls dead from the sword of A HEIJI
WARRIOR. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal --
DOZENS OF HEIJI WARRIORS SWARMING THE TOWN.
Fast. Stealthy. Leaping the low rooftops like a swarm of
grasshoppers. All over town. THE SOUND OF SLICING AND
KILLING as the droids pull off A SILENT MASSACRE.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. PAOZU VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT
Bulma and Goku arrive at the outskirts of Paozu Village.
Bulma checks her locator.
BULMA
According to the locator there’s a
Dragonball due-east of here.
VRRRRM. THEY HEAD OFF.
32.
EXT. PAOZU VILLAGE - MOVING - NIGHT
Bulma cruises the motorcycle slowly through the streets
of Paozu Village. Then they notice THE FIRST BODY. DEAD.
Then they see another. And another.
BULMA
Oh my God. What happened here?
GOKU
(a whisper)
The Nameks.
BULMA
This isn’t some board-game. This is real.
ON THE LOCATOR
They are getting closer to the Dragonball. The locator is
leading directly toward --
A LARGE CHURCH STEEPLE
It stands out from the rest of the city as it is
illuminated by -- FIRE! They are getting closer and
closer. THE SOUND OF VIOLENCE growing louder.
Bulma PULLS HER PISTOL and jams A 30 ROUND CLIP in the
bottom. She racks the slide ready to rock and roll.
BULMA (CONT’D)
When I say so, you take cover and don’t
come up until the shooting stops.
Goku pulls THE POWERPOLE off of his back and holds it at
the ready.
GOKU
I’m not afraid.
BULMA
Hey! Leave the fighting to me. You just
protect the Dragonballs. That’s your job.
Understand?
Goku says nothing.
BULMA (CONT’D)
UNDERSTAND?
Goku reluctantly nods yes. They round a corner to find --
33.
EXT. PAOZU VILLAGE - OLD CHURCH - NIGHT
CARNAGE!
HEIJI WARRIORS are battling MONKS dressed in BRIGHT
ORANGE ROBES very similar to Goku’s suit. Only theirs
look like Shoalin Monks crossed with Catholic Priests.
BULMA
Androids! I hate Androids.
The Monks battle hard doing a form of Shoalin Gung Fu,
but they are no match for the Heiji Warriors.
BULMA PUSHES GOKU OFF THE BIKE!
BULMA (CONT’D)
TAKE COVER!
Goku grabs the case and RELUCTANTLY ducks behind A
STATUE.
BULMA
GUNS THE THROTTLE and TEARS OFF INTO THE FRAY BLASTING
AWAY WITH HER FULLY AUTOMATIC PISTOL
HEIJI WARRIORS
ARE DROPPING LEFT AND RIGHT. BULMA IS A TOTAL BADASS!
BULMA
Guns the bike right up the stairs and INTO THE CHURCH!
WE HEAR:
THE SOUND OF GUN FIRE RINGING FROM INSIDE.
GOKU
Can’t stand it. His fists clench. His knuckles crack.
INT. OLD CHURCH - NIGHT
The interior of the church is a mixture of Roman Catholic
and Ancient Chinese Buddhist architecture. Which is now
BEING BLOWN TO BITS BY --
BULMA
Doing some very ACROBATIC shooting. A FIRE RAGES AROUND
THEM.
34.
Heiji Warriors are being blown to OILY NUTS AND BOLTS.
Soon they’re all dead. Bulma stands there with smoking
pistol in hand.
BULMA
That wasn’t so bad!
SUDDENLY --
C’CRASH!
STAINED GLASS WINDOWS surrounding her CRASH INWARD as --
SCORES OF HEIJI WARRIORS
Crash through the windows, weapons in hand. Bulma is
surrounded. Then --
FLFLFLFLFLFLP!
THE SOUND OF FLAPPING CLOTH as --
MAI
Leaps from the balcony and lands gracefully in front of
Bulma. SHE IS SILHOUETTED BY FLAME. AN EVIL CURVED SWORD
is in her hand.
BULMA (CONT’D)
Just the skank I’ve been looking for. You
and me have some unfinished business,
bitch!
Mai leaps into a fighting stance.
BULMA
Sticks her pistol in Mai’s face. Mai pouts and throws her
hands up in mock surrender.
BULMA (CONT’D)
You have five seconds to hand over my
Dragonball. ONE... TWO...
MAI is perfectly calm because she sees what Bulma doesn’t
see --
SHOU
LOOMING UP BEHIND HER. His HUGE RAZOR CLAWED GLOVE is
poised to RIP BULMA’S HEAD OFF.
SHOU STRIKES
WHAPPOW!
35.
Before his claw could connect -- Shou is BLASTED INTO A
MARBLE PILAR like a FORCE OF NATURE -- by
GOKU
Who stands there with leg extended in a perfect SIDE
THRUST.
BULMA
Turns around shocked to see him. She doesn’t see Shou,
who is now lying beneath a pile of rubble.
BULMA (CONT’D)
GOKU!
This is just enough time for --
MAI
To kick Bulma’s gun out of her hand. The GUN SAILS INTO
THE AIR. Mai drops into AN IRON BROOM AND SWEEPS BULMA
OFF HER FEET. Mai leaps into the air and CATCHES THE
FLYING GUN. She lands gracefully on her feet BLASTING AT
BULMA AND GOKU.
HEIJI WARRIORS ATTACK!
GOKU
TOSSES BULMA OUT OF THE WAY, PULLS OUT THE POWERPOLE and
LASHES INTO THE HEIJI WARRIORS LIKE A TORNADO!
BULMA
Stares slack-jawed AT THE FIGHTING PHENOMENON that is
Goku. Then -- POW!-ZING! A BULLET whizzes by her head
shot by MAI! Bulma pulls her back-up piece and BLASTS
BACK.
THEY LOW-RUN across the church BLASTING AT EACH OTHER
DODGING FLAMES.
GOKU
Has finished off most of the Heiji Warriors. When --
SHOU
Pulls himself from the rubble AND ATTACKS. He lashes out
at Goku with a wicked TIGER CLAW STYLE. But --
Goku
Is too fast. He ducks and weaves Shou’s attacks leaving
him CLAWING AT THE AIR. Goku does a HAND CRANK then --
36.
POW!
Punches Shou so hard, he flies across the church and
CRASHES THROUGH THE STONE WALL.
BULMA AND MAI
Are still shooting it out. Then Bulma sees it --
THE STOLEN DRAGONBALL LOCATOR
Strapped to Mai’s hip. Bulma aims and POW! HIT’S THE
LOCATOR SHATTERING IT TO BITS!
MAI
SCREAMS IN RAGE! SHE LEVELS HER GUN AT BULMA
BULMA
LEVELS HER GUN AT MAI. BULMA FIRES - CLICK! -- SHE’S
EMPTY.
MAI
FIRES. SUPER SLOW MOTION -- THE BULLET ROCKETS ACROSS THE
CHURCH headed directly for -- BULMA’S HEAD. Bulma’s a
goner for sure. Suddenly --
WHOOSH!
GOKU
Leaps between Bulma and the bullet. The bullet STRIKES
GOKU in the chest. He falls on top of Bulma.
MAI
PULLS HER SWORD and leaps into the air. DOES A SOMERSAULT
and lands directly over Goku and Bulma. SHE LUNGES THE
BLADE DOWNWARD to skewer them both but --
SHING!
GOKU
Catches it in HIS BARE HAND. He slowly rises staring Mai
in the eye.
GOKU
I don’t want to have to hit a woman
but...
Mai looks around at the slaughtered Heiji Warriors
surrounding her. She BACK-FLIPS away from Goku, pulls
something from her waist and TOSSES IT AT HER FEET!
37.
FWOOSH!
There is a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT AND SMOKE. When it
clears. -- MAI IS GONE.
Goku helps Bulma to her feet.
GOKU (CONT’D)
Are you okay?
BULMA
I’m fine. What about you? You’re Shot!
There is a bloodstain on Goku’s shirt. He seems
completely unfazed by it.
BULMA (CONT’D)
We better get you to a doctor.
Goku blows her off.
GOKU
Ahhh, no big deal. It’s just a bullet
wound.
BULMA
Where is the Dragonball?
Goku points to his backpack.
GOKU
Got it right here. Safe and sound.
Bulma looks at the spot where Mai disappeared.
BULMA
That bitch made off with my favorite gun.
They hear a noise. A labored breathing. They search
through the rubble of the church and find--
THE OLD PRIEST.
They rush to his side. The priest is in bad shape. Cut
and badly burned. THE FIRE IS STARTING TO RAGE OUT OF
CONTROL. The Priest looks up at Goku.
BULMA (CONT’D)
We better get you out of here!
The Priest looks up at Goku. Kind eyes. There is
recognition.
PRIEST
Ahh, Young Goku.
38.
GOKU
You know me?
PRIEST
I know of you. Gohan has spoken of you
many times. You’re just as he described.
(coughs and chokes)
He said one day you may come to me. And
if you would it would be tidings of dark
times.
(beat)
Go to the alter. There is a button behind
the head of the Buddha. Press it there,
you will find what you need.
Goku rushes to the Alter FLAMING DEBRIS starts to rain
down around him. A STATUE OF BUDDHA sits beneath A HUGE
CRUCIFIX. Goku reaches behind the Buddha's head and
presses the button.
THE CRUCIFIX SLIDES BACKWARDS REVEALING A SECRET
COMPARTMENT. Goku looks into the compartment and produces
A MAP, NAUTICAL CHARTS. And --
A DRAGONBALL.
Goku holds it up.
GOKU
Bulma look! It’s a...
He notices Bulma’s expression. The Priest is dead.
BULMA
(sadly)
He’s gone... He mentioned something about
a Turtle Island and a Master Roshi.
Goku looks at the nautical charts. It is clearly a map to
Turtle Island.
GOKU
These are directions to Master Roshi’s
Island. We have to go through the desert
wasteland to get to the sea. Then to
Turtle Island.
Bulma holds up the Dragonball. It has FIVE STARS ON IT.
BULMA
So much death because of these things.

EXT. PAOZU VILLAGE - NIGHT
Goku and Bulma ride out of town through a majestic canyon
silhouetted by the Old Church, NOW FULLY ENVELOPED IN
FLAME. A moment later it CRUMBLES TO THE GROUND.
INT. PAOZU CANYON - NIGHT
Goku and Bulma have set camp for the night beside a
beautiful waterfall. Bulma produces a capsule and it
morphs into a stylish tent.
Goku sits on the edge of a rock staring sadly at the
waterfall. Bulma sees how sad Goku is. She gives him a
moment. Then --
BULMA
Hey.
GOKU
Hey.
BULMA
How ya doin?
GOKU
I’m okay.
BULMA
How’s the chest?
Goku rolls his arm around.
GOKU
Fine no pain at...
(winces in pain)
Ouch!
Bulma sits down beside him.
BULMA
We’d better take a look at that bullet
wound. Here, let’s get that shirt off.
Bulma strips off Goku’s shirt revealing his muscular
form. She checks out the physique. Her expression betrays
her admiration. She shakes it off and gets to business
inspecting the wound. The bullet barely penetrated the
muscle.
BULMA (CONT’D)
It’s barely penetrated. Incredible. I’ve
never seen anything like that before.
40.
GOKU
I trained my body to be hard as a rock.
BULMA
Yes I can feel how -- hard you are. The
bullet’s still in there. I’ll have to get
it out before it becomes infected.
She pulls a first-aid kit from her backpack and starts to
tend to his wound, using forceps to dig the bullet out.
It is grossing her out.
GOKU
(wincing in pain)
Where’d you learn to shoot like that?
BULMA
(sarcastic)
I took Special Ops as an elective in
junior high. What about you? You were
pretty impressive back there. Where did
you learn to fight?
GOKU
My Grandpa taught me. He trained me all
my life.
BULMA
To fight space demons?
(beat)
Sorry, don’t mean to step on another
person’s beliefs. Whatever gets you
through the night I always say.
GOKU
If you don’t believe, why are you risking
your life to collect them? Is it just for
money and fame?
BULMA
Look, under normal circumstances I never
share my personal feelings with anybody.
But since you -- well -- saved my life,
you get special privileges.
(beat)
My father lost his life finding that
Dragonball. He had a dream of
revolutionizing the power industry. And
he died trying to do it. I’m just
continuing his work. So there it is.
That’s the deal.
A beat.
GOKU
Guess it makes you sad to think about
him?
41.
BULMA
I don’t think about him.
GOKU
Why not?
BULMA
Because that was in the past. I only
think about the future.
She stares sadly off into space. Goku understands. Goku
inspects the bandage. Checks the movement of his arm.
GOKU
Thank you for fixing my wound.
BULMA
Thank you for saving my life.
GOKU
You’re welcome.
They stare at each other. A moment of connection. Bulma
smiles at him.
BULMA
(endearingly)
You are such a geek.
Their faces get closer. A moment of chemistry then --
GOKU
(awkwardly)
Wow, you look really hot.
Chemistry is over. Bulma steps back and looks at Goku
irritated.
BULMA
Dude, lame pick-up lines? Give me a
break.

Uh... uh, you look really nice this

PILAF, MAI AND SHOU
Stroll through the high tech hall of monstrosities. Pilaf
inspects the broken locator.
PILAF
They think they can stop us from finding

There are many ways to skin a man.
They walk over to A LARGE METAL CAGE. SOMETHING BIG IS IN
THERE. Hidden in the shadows. We can barely make out it’s
form.
Mai walks over with BULMA’S PISTOL and tosses it through
the bars of the cage. Something horrifying emerges from
the shadow and SNIFFS AT THE PISTOL.
PILAF (CONT’D)
That’s it. Get her scent.
The beast lets out and EAR SPLITTING SCREECH THAT SOUNDS
LIKE THE SQUEALING OF A PIG MIXED WITH THE SCRAPING OF
METAL ON STONE!
PILAF (CONT’D)

killing it’s power.
Goku and Bulma regain their bearing just in time to see --
YAMCHA SAILING TOWARD THEM ON A ZIP LINE. He lands in
front of them and struts over to them with attitude to
spare. The wind WHIPS HIS HAIR DRAMATICALLY. What a hunk.
Bulma is smitten against her own will.
YAMCHA PULLS A FUTURISTIC SHOTGUN and levels it at them.
Goku and Bulma stand defiant.
YAMCHA
Good afternoon bitches! I’m Yamcha I’ll

Take your stuff.

YAMCHA WITH HIS FOOT. The stone knocks the SHOTGUN out of
Yamcha’s hand.
GOKU ATTACKS
Sailing at Yamcha with a wicked kicking combination.
YAMCHA’S NO SLOUCH
Yamcha dodges and weaves the combinations like Muhammad
Ali. THE FIGHT IS ON.
GOKU’S TECHNIQUES ARE FAST AND POWERFUL.
YAMCHA’S ARE SLICK AND EVASIVE. In other words -- TRICKY.
Yamcha fights with a cocky arrogance. It’s almost as if
looking cool is as important as being effective.
The tide of the battle is turning to Goku. Yamcha is
getting his ass kicked. He steps back. Regroups. Then he
prepares to unleash his signature move. He crouches low.
Hands making down-turned claws. HE SHOUTS.
YAMCHA
WOLF-FANG-FISTS!
WHOOSH! YAMCHA IS A BLUR as he lashes out a Goku with a
BADASSED hand combination that knocks Goku into a PILE OF
ROCKS SHATTERING THEM.
This only pisses Goku off more. HE DUPLICATES YAMCHA’S

CHIK-CHAK- BOOM!

SWOOSH!
BULMA IS SWEPT OFF OF THE GROUND BY THE CLAWED FEET OF -

BULMA (CONT’D)
AHHHHHHHHHH!
She is lifted skyward. Bulma reacts quickly. She fires
the shotgun into the beasts underbelly. BOOM! -- not much
effect. Again. CHIK-CHAK BOOM. BETTER EFFECT.
THE CREATURE DROPS HER. Bulma plummets to the ground.
YAMCHA AND GOKU
Rush to catch her. Yamcha is closer. UMMMMPH! HE CATCHES
HER. They land PAINFULLY ON THE GROUND. Yamcha is dazed.
Bulma is on top of him in a very suggestive position.
THE CREATURE ATTACKS AGAIN.
YAMCHA
Pushes Bulma off of him and attempts to defend himself
from the beast.
THE CREATURE
LASHES INTO YAMCHA
With clawed hands and feet. Yamcha is helpless against
the ground. He is getting ripped bloody. He’s dead meat
for sure. Suddenly --
WHIPPPOW!
GOKU ROUNDHOUSES THE SHIT OUT OF THE CREATURE. He whips
out the POWERPOLE and begins to BEAT THE HOLY HELL out of

roasting on a spit.
Bulma pets Puar the cat. Puar wiggles his way out of
Bulma’s arms sneaks up behind her and quite stealthily
PULLS HER WALLET OUT OF HER PANTS. Puar scampers off with
the stole goods.
Yamcha pulls a skewer off the fire and starts to gnaw on
the roasted snake. Bulma stares at him disgusted. Yamcha
offers her a bite.
BULMA
I don’t think so!
Goku is more than happy to chow down on some roasted
snake.
YAMCHA
Okay, lemme get this straight. You guys
are on your way to see some Kung Fu
master because the -- what did you call

Oh, sorry, the Nameks have returned from

forgive me but I really don’t follow that
geek shit....So, you guys are after my --

BULMA
Look that’s his story, not mine. I’m just
looking for the balls.
Yamcha smiles mischievously.
YAMCHA

Yamcha digs in a box full of JEWELRY and precious stones.
He unearths THE FOUR STAR DRAGONBALL.
YAMCHA (CONT’D)
Never knew this thing had any worth.
So -- whataya give me in trade?
GOKU

for it?
BULMA
(somewhat suggestively)
You tell me? What do you want.
Yamcha walks over and gets in her face.
YAMCHA
(just as suggestively)
What are you offering?
BULMA
I could offer you a lot, I just don’t
know if you’d be worth it.
YAMCHA
Cupcake, I’m worth anything you have to
offer.
Goku leaps in between them a hint of jealousy showing.
GOKU
You can have your life back. Give us the
ball and you don’t owe me anymore.
49.
YAMCHA
Naaaaa, as long as you have cupcake in
tow here I smell money and lots of it.
This is the deal. I give you the ball and
you pay me -- seven figures -- No strings
-- deal?
BULMA
If money’s all you -- desire -- then we
have a deal.
YAMCHA
Good because that is all I desire Sister.
Bulma pulls out her checkbook and begins scribbling on a
check.
BULMA
Okay, spell your last name.
Yamcha burst out in laughter.
YAMCHA
Yeah, right! Like I’m gonna take a check
from you? Sorry sister, Cash on the
barrel-head is the only way I roll. And
just to make sure you don’t try to pull a
fast one -- I’m comin’ along.
GOKU
HEY! Nobody invited you!
Yamcha starts getting his gear together.
YAMCHA
Sorry kid! Goes with the deal. I have to
protect my interest. By the way... Where
are we going?
GOKU
WE’RE going to Shippingport.
YAMCHA
Rough place you’re gonna need me.
Yamcha swaggers into the next room. Bulma stares at him
barely able to hide her lust. Goku stares after Yamcha
jealously.
CUT TO:
50.
EXT. YAMCHA’S LAIR - PRE-DAWN
Everyone is packing up and preparing for the next leg of
the journey. Yamcha notices Goku staring at him. He walks
over to him.
YAMCHA
Listen kid. I can tell you’re soft on
Cupcake over there. Does that mean that
me and you are gonna be butting heads
this whole trip?
GOKU
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
YAMCHA
Yeah, right. Listen, if it’s any
consolation to you. There’s only one
thing she’s got that I’m interested in --
and that’s money. Far as I’m concerned --
She’s all yours kid.
BULMA
(calling for Yamcha)
Yaaamcha -- I think you better ride with
me.
YAMCHA
Sorry Cupcake. I ride alone.
Yamcha digs through his pile of STOLEN MERCHANDISE and
pulls the tarp off of -- THE COOLEST FUTURISTIC ATV
YOU’VE EVER SEEN.
GOKU
Guess it’s you and me Bulma.
BULMA
(disappointed)
Whatever.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. ROCKY CANYON ROAD - EARLY MORNING
The two cool vehicles zoom through the rocky canyon road.
They keep trading off the lead. Yamcha periodically POPS
WHEELIES and hot dogs on his ATV.
INT. DUNE-BUGGY - SAME
Bulma’s attention is split between her locator and
Yamcha. Goku looks at the map.
51.
BULMA
Look at him. What a show off.
GOKU
It looks like Shippingport is close by.
BULMA
He thinks he’s so hot.
GOKU
To the East.
BULMA
Like I’m supposed to be impressed by that
childish behavior.
GOKU
About 20 miles or so.
Yamcha hollers over at him.
YAMCHA
SHIPPINGPORT’S ABOUT 20 MILES DUE EAST.
FOLLOW ME!
Yamcha POPS A WHEELIE and VROOOM zooms off. Bulma
follows.
BULMA
I hate him.
GOKU
I like you Bulma.
BULMA
Aww, that’s sweet Goku. You’re a pal.
She ruffles Goku’s hair like a puppy. Ouch!
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SHIPPINGPORT - DAY
Shippingport is a dirty little fishing town sitting by
the sea. The fishing industry has long since dried up.
Piracy and vice are it’s newest driving industries.
The two vehicles roll down a filthy street lined with
hookers and numerous seedy types. Homeless people sleep
right on the sidewalk.
YAMCHA
Ahh, Shippingport. My home away from
home.
52.
BULMA
Jesus, I preferred the wasteland.
GOKU
We need to find a boat.
YAMCHA
Leave it to me. I know just the place.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. THE SINGLE WHIP TAVERN - DAY
They park their vehicles in front of the seedy looking
bar.
GOKU
Hey, what is this place? Why don’t we
just go to the docks and charter a boat
from a reputable dealer.
Yamcha laughs at Goku’s naivete.
YAMCHA
Kid this is a pirate town. You wanna rent
a boat this is the most reputable place.
Suddenly --
TWO THUGS BURST THROUGH THE FRONT DOORS FIGHTING. One
Thug pulls a pistol AND SHOOTS THE OTHER one dead.
Yamcha casually steps over the corpse of the dead thug
and motions for a shocked Goku and Bulma to follow.
YAMCHA (CONT’D)
You guys coming?
INT. THE SINGLE WHIP TAVERN - CONTINUOUS
The trio enter the seedy bar. Everyone turns and looks at
them with murderous contempt in their eyes. Yamcha nods
to the patrons and they go back to their business.
YAMCHA
Folks around here are kind of suspicious
of newcomers. Okay, I’m gonna need some
cash. These types don’t take checks or
credit cards.
Bulma hands Yamcha a small handful of cash.
53.
BULMA
This is all I have. I seem to have lost
my wallet.
Yamcha averts his gaze to Goku.
YAMCHA
Alright kid ante-up.
Goku stares at Yamcha reluctant.
YAMCHA (CONT’D)
You wanna get out to that Island don’t
ya?
BULMA
Go ahead Goku, I’ll pay you back.
Goku reluctantly hands Yamcha all of his cash. Yamcha
counts it out. Just a few hundred RMB. Yamcha takes the
cash and puts it into A CONVENIENT ENVELOP he just
happened to have on him.
YAMCHA
This ain’t much. But I’ll see if I can
call in a few favors. You two stay here.
Just play it cool. I’ll be right back.
(beat)
Oh, and don’t look anyone in the eyes or
they’ll shoot you.
Yamcha walks over to a table filled with some of the
slimiest looking creeps you could imagine.
GOKU
I don’t trust him.
Yamcha opens up the envelope and counts out the money for
the creeps. He then seals the envelope and sticks it in
his back pocket. They negotiate some more.
GOKU (CONT’D)
I say we just leave. We can trade the
motorcycle for a boat.
BULMA
What’s with you Goku. Yamcha’s got the
situation under control.
Yamcha hands the envelope over to THE HEAD SCUMBAG and he
hands Yamcha A SET OF KEYS. Yamcha shakes their hands.
Deals closed. He walks back to Bulma and Goku.
YAMCHA
I told you. I got a honey of a deal. We’d
better hurry.
54.
EXT. SHIPPINGPORT - PIER 12 - DAY
Goku, Bulma and Yamcha are loading the last of their
stuff on THE MOST RAMSHACKLE JUNK IN THE HARBOR.
GOKU
I hope this thing will make it to turtle
Island.
YAMCHA
Don’t worry kid. She may look ugly but
she’s sea-worthy.
An ANGRY VOICE RINGS OUT.
ANGRY VOICE (O.S.)
YAMCHA YOU SON OF A BITCH!
They look down the pier. IT’S THE SCUMBAGS FROM THE BAR
headed their way ARMED AND ANGRY!
YAMCHA
Okay, It’s time to go.
Yamcha rushes to the bridge and turns over the engine. IT
COUGHS, SPUTTERS, BELCHES BLACK SMOKE -- AND DIES.
GUNSHOTS RING OUT! WOOD AND DEBRIS EXPLODE AROUND THEM.
Goku and Bulma duck.
BULMA
THEY’RE SHOOTING AT US!
Yamcha is still trying to turn over the engine.
YAMCHA
SHOOT BACK!
Bulma returns fire. The Scumbags duck for cover then --
RATTATTTATATTATAT! MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
THE JUNK IS BEING RIPPED TO SHREDS AROUND THEM.
GOKU
HURRY UP AND GET THAT THING STARTED!
BROOOOMM-BLUBLUBLUBLUB! The engine turns over. Yamcha
jams the wheel and pulls out full throttle as MACHINE-GUN
FIRE continues to shred the deck around them.
Soon they leave the scumbags behind at the pier. The Head
Scumbag holds up an envelope filled with BLANK SCRAPS OF
PAPER!
55.
HEAD SCUMBAG
YAMCHA YOU THIEVING BASTARD! YOU’RE DEAD!
DO YOU HEAR ME! YOU’RE DEAD! ALL OF YOU
ARE DEAD!
Soon the junk is well out to sea. Bulma turns to Yamcha.
BULMA
You ripped them off!
YAMCHA
Little trick I call “the switch.” Hey,
they were thieves. I grifted them. They
got what they deserved.
GOKU
Yeah but you grifted US to!
Yamcha smiles and pulls out the envelope.
YAMCHA
Oh, that? Hey, I was gonna give you the
money back - really.
Bulma snatches the envelope from Yamcha.
BULMA
(flabbergasted)
You... you are a thief and a liar and
a... a...
YAMCHA
You don’t have to say anymore, Cupcake. I
know you want me.
BULMA SMACKS YAMCHA then storms below deck. Leaving Goku
glaring at Yamcha.
YAMCHA (CONT’D)
Better make you move quick, kid, cause
she’s all over me.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. TURTLE ISLAND - MORNING
An eerie morning mist covers the island as the old Junk
sails slowly to shore. The setting is mystic, etherial.
Goku is particularly affected.
GOKU
(somewhat in awe)
This is it. The realm of the last great
master.
56.
The Old Junk pulls into a rickety old pier. Goku, Yamcha
and Bulma leap off and head to shore. Yamcha ties the
Junk to the pier.
They stroll cautiously onto the mist covered shore. Bulma
pulls her locator.
BULMA
There’s a Dragonball on this island.
Suddenly --
A FIGURE SLOWLY APPEARS FROM THE MIST. They all stop
ready for anything then --
AN ECCENTRIC OLD COOT (mid 70’s) saunters into view. He
wears baggy Bermuda shorts, a colorful Hawaiian shirt and
sunglasses. He carries A BOX FULL OF TRINKETS.
OLD COOT
WELCOME TO TURTLE ISLAND!
He rushes over and places FLOWER LEIS around their necks.
OLD COOT (CONT’D)
Well, we don’t get many visitors here.
But when we do we always try to be
prepared.
He pulls out a box of TRINKETS and begins pulling them
from the box for display.
OLD COOT (CONT’D)
Can I interest you in some rare Turtle
Island collectables. We have Turtle
Island sunglasses, Turtle Island watches.
Turtle Island cup-holders. And of course
you can’t forget the soon to be famous
Turtle Island T-shirt one size fits all.
He admires Bulma.
OLD COOT (CONT’D)
Well, I suppose you’re eager to slip into
a string bikini, and hit the beach for a
little sun. Hmmm.
BULMA
(mildly grossed)
Ew.
GOKU
We’re here to see Master Roshi.
OLD COOT
Ahh, Master Roshi. The all powerful
master of martial arts.
57.
(MORE)
The last of the Great Masters. The mighty
manipulator of the elements. Well, you’re
in luck --
(dramatic pause)
That’s me!
Goku, Yamcha and Bulma stare at him like -- you gotta be
kidding.
YAMCHA
You gotta be kidding.
MASTER ROSHI
Skeptical are you? Then watch this!
Roshi breaks into AN ELABORATE MARTIAL ARTS FORM that
ends with him throwing a kick. His slipper flies off of
his foot AND CONKS HIM IN THE HEAD.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
New flip flops. Haven’t broken em’ in
yet.
GOKU
How do we know you’re Master Roshi?
Roshi points to a large boulder nearby.
MASTER ROSHI
If I weren’t Master Roshi, would I be
able to levitate that boulder? Huh?...
Well?
YAMCHA
Well... Go ahead and levitate it.
MASTER ROSHI
What do ya take me for... A show-off!
BULMA
C’mon Yamcha, Goku, let’s go.
She pulls out her locator and starts to walk off. Goku
and Yamcha follow.
MASTER ROSHI
GOKU? GOKU? -- Why, you’re Gohan’s boy!
Goku stops and turns around.
GOKU
You knew my Grandpa?
MASTER ROSHI
Of course I know Gohan. He was my best
student. How is the young nipper these
days?
58.
OLD COOT (CONT'D)
GOKU
He’s dead.
Roshi turns serious.
MASTER ROSHI
Oh, my. That’s sad news. Sad news indeed.
If you’re here and he’s gone, that can
only mean one thing.
Goku nods his head gravely.
GOKU
It’s true.
MASTER ROSHI
(solemnly)
You’re here to collect that money I owed
him.
GOKU
NO! -- THE NAMEK-JINS HAVE RETURNED!
MASTER ROSHI
(relieved)
Phwew! I thought you were here to
collect...
(alarmed)
WHOA! Did you just say that the NamekJins have returned?
GOKU
Yes. Didn’t you sense their presence?
MASTER ROSHI
Why... Yes! Yes! I’m sensing it now! It’s
comin’ to me. Brrr. Real evil! Yep that’s
them alright. We have to prepare for
battle. Follow me.
Roshi heads up the beach.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
C’mon Goku, Yamcha.
(to Bulma)
You too Bulma.
Bulma turns around.
BULMA
Hey! I never told you my name! How did
you know.
59.
MASTER ROSHI
(turning philosophical)
The knowledge of all things is in the
ether. The knowledgable one can pluck it
from the heavens like fruit.
Roshi turns and heads off down the beach with the bearing
of a wise sage.
BULMA
That was deep.
She heads off down the beach after Goku, Yamcha and
Roshi. We see on the back of her jacket in BIG VARSITY
LETTERS the name -- BULMA.
EXT. KAME HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - MORNING
It is a very typical, mid-western looking house. On the
side of it is painted KAME HOUSE. Roshi, Yamcha, Goku and
Bulma enter.
MASTER ROSHI (O.S.)
Welcome to Kame House. The training
ground of martial arts masters.
INT. KAME HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The inside looks like a typical family home. Minus a
woman’s touch. It’s kind of messy. They enter the living
room. A YOUNG TEEN (16), muscular, bald sits eating
popcorn and watching THE WORLD MARTIAL ARTS TOURNAMENT on
TV.
MASTER ROSHI
This is my newest student Krillin.
Krillin I’d like you to meet Bulma,
Yamcha and Goku.
Krillin turns around and gives the thumbs up to them. He
smiles at Goku. Goku smiles back. They instantly like
each other.
Roshi leads them into his den.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
This way you two, we’ll consult the Great
Master’s handbook.
INT. KAME HOUSE - ROSHI’S DEN - CONTINUOUS
Roshi’s den is even messier than the rest of the house.
It is plastered with posters of THE AEROBICS WOMEN. Hot
chicks in leotards doing exercises.
60.
Roshi looks around puzzled.
MASTER ROSHI
Now where did I put that book.
Goku instinctively points to AN OLD CHEST nearly hidden
beneath a pile of junk.
GOKU
Maybe it’s in there.
MASTER ROSHI
Ah, yes my old chest. Good call young
fella.
Roshi opens it up and begins to dig through it. GIRLY
MAGAZINES FLY OUT.
BULMA
Eww.
Turtle Island collectables fly out. A THREE STAR
DRAGONBALL FLIES OUT. Roshi keeps digging seemingly
oblivious to the treasure he’s just unearthed.
BULMA (CONT’D)
Whoa!
MASTER ROSHI
Ahh, here it is. The Great Master’s
handbook.
Roshi pulls out AN OLD BOOK. He begins leafing through it
making little humming noises to himself. Goku and Bulma
inspect the Dragonball. Yamcha leafs through a girly
magazine.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
Ah, here we are. It says here. When the
Nameks return, one master must find and
protect the seven Dragonballs while the
rest must defend the world from the
invaders.
GOKU
Grandpa designated me as protector of the
Dragonballs.
MASTER ROSHI
Then that is your destiny, Young Goku.
You must collect and protect them and I,
as the last Master WILL DO BATTLE WITH
PICCOLO!
(beat)
That is if they are able to resurrect
him, mind you.
(scratches his head)
61.
(MORE)
There’s no telling where the Dragonballs
could be. They could be anywhere.
He notices the Dragonball in Bulma’s hand.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
Hey, you have one. Where’d you get that?
BULMA
It’s yours. You just dug it out of that
box.
MASTER ROSHI
Well, how about that. Now all we have to
do is find six more...
GOKU
Two more. We already have five.
MASTER ROSHI
Wow, what a team. You guys are on top of
things. Now all we have to do is collect
the rest and get to the Shrine of the
Eternal Dragon before the eclipse.
(ominous tone)
For when the darkness comes, The OOZARU
will rise from the darkness and...
BULMA
(cutting him off)
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK! If I hear one more
word about Demons or Monsters from outer
space, I’m gonna BUST!
Bulma flies off into a full blown rant.
BULMA (CONT’D)
The world wasn’t destroyed by demons from
outer space...
GOKU
Well technically, the Demon Piccolo
didn’t actually do the destroying...
BULMA
WHATEVER! The world was destroy by THE
SHIFTING OF TECTONIC PLATES. A NATURAL
PHENOMENON. THERE’S NOTHING MAGICAL ABOUT
IT! These -- Dragonballs -- are nothing
more than some undiscovered sources of
power not unlike plutonium or uranium
when they were first discovered. They are
merely something that has not been
figured out yet-- Okay!
(beat)
62.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT'D)
(MORE)
But rather than see the future -- LESSER
MINDS just can’t bear to let go of their
ROMANTICIZED, PRIMITIVE belief that these
things are some kind of mythic objects of
MAGICAL POWER!
(beat)
THERE’S A SCIENTIFIC ANSWER FOR
EVERYTHING PEOPLE! And the only monsters
you have to worry about are the assholes
from greedy, rival corporations that will
stop at nothing to get their hands on MY
FATHER’S DISCOVERY!
YAMCHA
(not even looking up from his
magazine)
Here, here! Daddy’s discovery. Gotta make
that money.
GOKU
Then why do you call them Dragonballs?
BULMA
Because it’s easier to say than --
Orbicular metamorphic anomalies.
Bulma storms out of the room slamming the door behind
her. Goku and Roshi stare at the door.
MASTER ROSHI
Feisty, that one!
GOKU
She lost her father.
YAMCHA
She lost her head.
MASTER ROSHI
Ah, very sad. But it will be much sadder
if Piccolo is resurrected.
(deadly earnest)
The fate of the world is in our hands.
YAMCHA
(not even looking up from his
magazine)
Here, here. Fate of the world. Gotta save
it.
MASTER ROSHI
We leave first thing in the morning.

Pilaf begins to scan the wound on the Creature’s head
with a high tech looking device. The double helix patters
of DNA appear on the device’s screen. One particular code
locks in. Pilaf’s expression changes. He has a look in
his eye like NOW IT’S ALL CLEAR.
PILAF (CONT’D)
Ahh, I know who you are by now. I should
have expected as much. You are powerful
indeed.
MAI
Then how do we battle them sir?
PILAF
We don’t. We make them defeat themselves.

Yamcha is at the helm. Roshi stands on the bow staring
straight ahead. He looks like he’s in a trance. Goku and
Bulma join him.
YAMCHA
Well, which way?
 Roshi points majestically to the horizon.
MASTER ROSHI
I sense that there is a Dragonball in
that direction.
64.
BULMA
That’s the direction we just came from.
According to my locator, the nearest
Dragonball is due West.
(to Yamcha)
Set your course due West.
Yamcha sets the auto pilot. Then comes down and joins
them.
YAMCHA
Good thing she has that locator.
MASTER ROSHI
(sniffs)
Hmmph! Locators. Back in my day we used
our senses. We could feel the energy of
them.
BULMA
Well thank goodness we’re not back in
your day. Because we’d be heading back to
Turtle Island right now. Quit living in
the past, Gramps.
MASTER ROSHI
Those who cannot remember the past are
condemned to repeat it.
YAMCHA
Past, future, what difference does it
make? You can’t live in the past and
you’re not promised a future, so why
sweat it. Enjoy life now.
MASTER ROSHI
Yamcha, we’re talking about the end of
the world here. The end of everything
you’ve ever known, and everything you
will know.
YAMCHA
Big deal. It’s gotta end someday. But
until that day comes I’m gonna get mine --
BULMA
God you are so shallow!

Their wagon rounds a bend and there standing in front of

EXT. MIDDLE OF THE SEA - EVENING
A THICK FOG BLANKETS THE SEA. Visibility is low. Bulma is

ON THE DECK
Goku and Roshi start training.
MASTER ROSHI
I will continue your training where Gohan
left off. Is that his powerpole on your
back?
GOKU
Yes it is.
MASTER ROSHI
Hand it to me.
Goku hands the pole to Roshi. Roshi brandishes it like a
pro. He spins it over his head a couple of times.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
This pole is more powerful than you know.
By force of your will and concentrating
your Chi, you can make this pole extend
to unlimited lengths.
GOKU
Can you do it Master Roshi?
66.
MASTER ROSHI
Of course I can. You must brandish the
pole like this.
He holds the pole in a THRUST POSITION.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
You concentrate your Chi, then you say --
POWERPOLE EXTEND!
Nothing.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
POWERPOLE EXTEND!
Still nothing. Roshi looks embarrassed for a moment then.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
Okay, training’s over. Let’s play ball.
Roshi pulls out A COLORFUL BALL PAINTED WITH THE YIN-YANG
symbol. He spins it on his finger like a Harlem
Globetrotter.
GOKU
Ball?
MASTER ROSHI
Not just any kind of ball. Kame-catch! It
was all the rage back in my day. Here’s
how you do it.
He holds the ball at his hips. Arms bowed.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
...embrace the ball.
He thrusts his hands forward.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
...throw the ball. Now you do it.
Goku follows Roshi’s lead. He embraces the ball and
TOSSES IT. The ball hits Roshi in the chest and nearly
KNOCKS HIM DOWN.

there is NOTHING TO BE FOUND as far as the eye can see.
Once on shore they unpack the boat. Roshi does his trancelike thing again.
MASTER ROSHI
I sense a Dragonball in...

...that direction.
Bulma consults her locator.
BULMA
According to this, there’s one twenty-six
miles due East.
MASTER ROSHI
That direction too.
GOKU
How are we gonna get there? The bike and
the ATV are back in Shippingport.
MASTER ROSHI
Why back in my day we’d travel by a
Flying Nimbus, a great cloud of energy

strongest and purest of heart could ride.
Bulma pulls another one of her capsules from her
backpack.

Let’s go. Quietly. Cautiously.
He begins to PUSH THEM ALL AHEAD OF HIM.

Yamcha makes a “zipping my lips” gesture. They get closer

the great prophesy. Are you all Great
Masters?
MASTER ROSHI
No, I’m the only Great Master here.
SUNO
Are you gonna kill Piccolo?
MASTER ROSHI
If I can. My powers aren’t what they used
to be. But back in my day... Who hoo! I
could ride the flying nimbus and unleash
techniques so powerful...
As Roshi rambles on we --
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SNOW COVERED PEAKS - DAY
They’ve abandoned the vehicle and are now travelling on
foot. Goku carries Suno on his back
SUNO
So you’re the protector of the
Dragonballs.
Goku is uncharacteristically unfriendly It’s as if he can
sense something is not quite right about this young girl.
GOKU
Yes.
71.
SUNO
Where do you keep them?
GOKU
In a case in my backpack.
SUNO
You’re really strong. Do you think you
can beat Piccolo if he comes?
GOKU
I don’t know.
(beat)
You shouldn’t ask too many questions
Suno.
SUNO
I’m sorry
(beat)
Bulma sure is pretty. You and her remind
me of my mommy and daddy.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. RAGING RIVERS - DAWN
They are crossing through RAPIDS. The water is up to
their hips. Suno rides on Yamcha’s back.
SUNO
So you don’t care about Piccolo and the
prophesy?
YAMCHA
I’ll worry about it if it happens.
SUNO
And Bulma’s gonna give you a lot of
money?
YAMCHA
Why do ya wanna know kid? You wanna cut
or something?...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. RAIN FORREST - CAMPSITE - NIGHT
The crew has set up camp for the evening. They gather
around a fire. And plan their strategy.
BULMA
According to my locator. The sixth ball
is two days away. What about the seventh?
72.
MASTER ROSHI
Well it’s obvious that the seventh ball
was the one stolen from you. As long we
get to the Dragon temple I’m sure that
The Nameks will show up with the seventh.
There we’ll set up a trap and take the
seventh Dragonball. We will summon the
Dragon and wish the Nameks away.
YAMCHA
And, what kind of trap are you talking
about specifically?
MASTER ROSHI
Haven’t figured that one out yet.
YAMCHA
(sarcastic)
We’re doomed.
BULMA
That is if your prophesy is true.
MASTER ROSHI
Still not a believer Bulma, after all
you’ve seen.
BULMA
Well I’ll admit the stuff I’ve seen has
got me thinking. But until I see this
Piccolo and this Dragon with my own eyes
I’m gonna be skeptical. It’s my nature.
YAMCHA
So, who’s gonna do this Dragon summoning?
GOKU
I’ll summon the Dragon. It’s my destiny.
Yamcha yawns and unrolls his blanket.
YAMCHA
Sounds like a plan to me. The only thing
I’m gonna be summoning is a nice big
check courtesy of Cupcake here.
Everybody gets ready for bed. Bulma opens one of her
capsules and A COZY TENT POPS OUT.
BULMA
Sorry boys. Tent’s just for the girls.
(looks at Yamcha)
And no peeking.
YAMCHA
Don’t flatter yourself sister.
73.
Bulma stares at Yamcha eyes narrowed. Then she walks over
to Goku and KISSES HIM ON THE CHEEK.
BULMA
Goodnight Goku.
She walks over and KISSES ROSHI on his cheek.
BULMA (CONT’D)
Goodnight Master Roshi.
MASTER ROSHI
Whoo hoo! Now that brings back memories.
She walks over to Yamcha. AND TURNS HER NOSE UP AT HIM.
Then she and Suno enter the tent. Yamcha looks over at
Goku.
YAMCHA
Like I said before, you can have her.
INT. BULMA’S TENT - NIGHT
The inside of the tent is GIRLY TO THE MAX. Lots of pink
everywhere. She climbs under the covers. Suno joins her.
Bulma hands her A TEDDY BEAR. Then she takes her PISTOL,
loads it and slides it under her pillow.
SUNO
What’s that for?
BULMA
It’s for some skank that ripped me off. I
have a bullet with her name on it.
For an instant Suno’s eyes narrow. Then --
SUNO
What’s a skank?
BULMA
You’re too young to know.
And with that Bulma turns off the light and she and goes
to sleep.
SUNO
(under her breath)
I’ll show you who’s a skank, bitch!
DISSOLVE TO:
74.
EXT. THE VILLAGE OF OXFORD - DAY
Our heros emerge from A THICK FOG. As the fog clears they
find themselves entering THE TOWN OF OXFORD.
IT IS A PLACE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE’VE SEEN SO FAR. A
civilization at the end of the world. The houses look
like a rural third world community.
It’s as if the sun abandoned this once striving mining
town. The place is like a ghost town.
Storefronts are boarded up. Curtains are drawn. Shutters
closed. Nary a soul is on the street. Garbage and debris
blows through the streets like tumbleweed.
They enter cautiously. Bulma consults her locator.
BULMA
There’s definitely a Dragonball in this
town.
GOKU
Where is everybody?
YAMCHA
This town is dead, man.
They round a corner and see something really disturbing.
On a wall painted in drippy red paint are is the word --
CURSED!
MASTER ROSHI
Well that’s not a good sign.
Suddenly, A VOICE RINGS OUT.
VOICE
WHO ARE YOU? -- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
GOKU AND YAMCHA leap in front of the others. They cop
FIGHTING STANCES. They find themselves facing --
THE BIGGEST HUMAN BEING THEY’VE EVER SEEN.
THE OX KING (40’s) Bearded nearly seven feet tall. He
looks like a Viking crossed with a Sheik. The Ox King
wields A LARGE AXE with menacing ease.
THE OX KING
Are you opportunists? Thieves? Here to
take advantage of our misfortune?
75.
GOKU
No we’re not. But I suggest you drop that
Axe.
YAMCHA
Yeah, drop the axe porky or you’re gonna
get your ass kicked.
The Ox King spins the axe over his head like a propeller.
THE OX KING
(snarling)
THE ONLY PLACE I’LL DROP THIS AXE IS ON
YOUR HEADS!
HE SWINGS THE AXE DOWN WITH ENOUGH FORCE TO SPLIT A
REDWOOD! In a FLASH OF LIGHT --
ROSHI
Leaps in front of Goku and Yamcha with his hand raised.
The Ox King STOPS IN MID SWING. The axe just inches from
Roshi’s outstretched hand.
MASTER ROSHI
STOP IT OX!
The Ox King DROPS TO HIS KNEES and bows his head in
reverence.
THE OX KING
Master! Forgive me.
Goku, Yamcha, Bulma and Suno look at each other then at
Master Roshi with new eyes.
CUT TO:
INT. THE OX KING’S HOME - LATER
The Ox King’s home is poor, but comfortable. There is
definitely a woman’s touch to the Macho guy’s home.
THE OX KING
Sifu Roshi. It’s been a long time. You
look well. Very young.
MASTER ROSHI
As young as I could look for a man 2000
years old.
THE OX KING
You don’t look a day older than 1000.
Goku, Bulma and Yamcha watch these two men talk like fans
at a tennis game.
76.
MASTER ROSHI
It seems as though dark times have fallen
on your little hamlet here.
THE OX KING
Dark times indeed. And you’re being here
with Gohan’s boy is a sign that dark
times may befall us all. Are the signs
true?
MASTER ROSHI
I’m afraid so. The Nameks have come to
resurrect their king. So what’s going on
here?
The Ox King looks grim. His voice lowers.
THE OX KING
It was three weeks ago today that -- It
arrived. -- The Oolong -- The Beast. And
every night since. It takes one of the
towns daughters.
GOKU
(darkly)
Three weeks, that’s when Grandpa was
killed.
MASTER ROSHI
When Dragonballs fall into evil hands.
Dark things awaken.
Grim silence.
YAMCHA
So why don’t you leave?
THE OX KING
Many have tried and all have failed.
Their bodies hung in the middle of town
as a warning.
(beat)
We are prisoners here.
GOKU
(clenching his fist)
THEN FIGHT!
THE OX KING
We cannot fight what we cannot touch. For
the Oolong is not a beast as much as he
is a wraith. A wretched spirit filled
with malice towards the living. It lives
by sucking souls from the most innocent
of us.
Bulma hugs Suno.
77.
THE OX KING (CONT’D)
I fear my daughter may be next. I keep
her hidden so that the Oolong will not
see her.
He calls to her.
THE OX KING (CONT’D)
Chi-Chi. Bring it here.
The door to the next room opens and in walks -- THE
PUREST, MOST BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL IN THE WORLD. Goku
looks like he’s JUST SEEN AN ANGEL. Meet CHI-CHI (17)
In her hands she carries. THE SEVEN STAR DRAGONBALL.
THE OX KING (CONT’D)
I know that this is what you came for.
And you can have it. Your mission is more
important than saving just one town.
But...
(beat)
Sifu -- you have trained me to be strong,
but I am not strong enough to defeat this
evil. Only a Great Master can. Sifu
please, help us. I don’t want to lose my
daughter.
Chi-Chi walks over and embraces her father. Everyone is
moved my The Ox King’s touching plea. Roshi walks over
and places a hand on The Ox King’s shoulder.
MASTER ROSHI
My friend. I am old and not as strong as
I used to be. There is no guarantee that
I could defeat the Oolong either.
(beat)
Let me sleep on it.
THE OX KING
Then be our guests for dinner.
Chi-Chi looks over at Goku. Goku at Chi-Chi. The
chemistry is instant and real. Bulma notices this too and
is a little off-put at not being the center of attention.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE VILLAGE OF OXFORD - DUSK
The sun is starting to set in this gloomy town. An
ominous wind howls through the streets.
78.
INT. THE OX KING’S HOME - EVENING
Everyone sits around the dining room table. The room is
lit by candle light. Chi-Chi sets the last of the food on
the table. Then sits down next to Goku. Bulma sits on his
other side.
Goku and Chi-Chi can’t take their eyes off of each other.
Everyone notices. The Ox King raise his glass.
THE OX KING
To new friends and brighter times.
MASTER ROSHI
Here, here!
They all raise their glasses. Then they dig in.
CHI-CHI
Goku, could you pass me the potatoes?
GOKU
Sure.
Goku takes the bowl of mashed potatoes and serves Chi-Chi
several heaping spoons full. Way more than she could
probably eat.
CHI-CHI
That’s plenty, Goku. Thank you.
BULMA
I’d like some potatoes too Goku.
Goku continues to smile at Chi-Chi.
BULMA (CONT’D)
(clearing her throat)
I’d like some too Goku.
Goku hands Bulma the bowl without even looking at her.
Bulma looks indignant. Yamcha is loving it. He smirks at
her. She flashes him an ugly look. Chi-Chi notices all of
this too.
CHI-CHI
I really like your hair Bulma.
BULMA
(touching her hair)
What this mess?
CHI-CHI
I think it’s beautiful. As a matter of
fact you’re probably the prettiest girl
I’ve ever seen.
79.
Bulma blushes then smiles at Chi-Chi.
BULMA
Thank you. You’re pretty hot yourself.
The ice is broken. Smiles all around the table now.
MASTER ROSHI
(whispers to The Ox King)
Quite the diplomat your daughter.
SUDDENLY AN EAR SPLITTING WAIL SOUNDS FROM OUTSIDE! Like
the sound of a squealing pig mixed with SQUEAKING CHALK.
THE OX KING INSTANTLY BLOWS OUT ALL THE CANDLE. He grabs
Chi-Chi and they duck to the floor.
THE OX KING
(whispering harshly)
Get down everybody. Don’t say a word.
Don’t breath.
(ominous beat)
It’s come early tonight.
They all drop to the floor. Quiet. Not moving.
Frightened. Then THEY HEAR IT.
A DEEP UNSETTLING BREATHING like the SNIFFING OF AN
ANIMAL searching for prey. It gets louder. And louder.
Goku looks toward the front door.
GOKU’S POV
WE SEE THROUGH THE CRACK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR
THE OUTSIDE. Suddenly --
A SHADOW. LIKE A BILLOWING INSUBSTANTIAL CLOTH. THE
OOLONG IS RIGHT OUTSIDE.
The shadow stops. Moves closer to the door. THE BREATHING
NOISE STOPS. -- DEAD SILENCE. Just the sound of our
hero’s breath -- then --
WHOOSH! IT JETS AWAY.
A BEAT THEN --
THE DISTANT SCREAM OF A WOMAN’S VOICE.
SCREAMING WOMAN (O.S.)
Noooo! Please! Leave her alone. NOOOOOOO!
The Ox King and Chi-Chi put their hands over their ears.
Goku can’t stand it any more. HE LEAPS UP AND GRABS HIS
POWERPOLE.
80.
MASTER ROSHI
GOKU NO!
GOKU BOLTS OUT THE FRONT DOOR!
EXT. THE VILLAGE OF OXFORD - STREETS - NIGHT
Goku stands in the middle of the deserted street weapon
in hand. Burning with anger.
GOKU
COME AND FIGHT DEMON! COME FIGHT ME!
THAT HORRIBLE SHRIEK AGAIN THEN--
THE SHADOW BLOWS PAST GOKU LIKE A PHANTOM FREIGHT TRAIN
KNOCKING GOKU UNCONSCIOUS.
BLACKOUT:
FADE IN:
INT. THE OX KING’S HOME - CHI-CHI’S ROOM - LATER
Goku wakes up. His vision is BLURRED. As his focus
returns, the first thing he sees is -- Chi-Chi sitting
beside him mopping his brow with a wet cloth.
As his focus returns completely, he sees that everyone is
around him.
CHI-CHI
Are you okay Goku?
GOKU
I’m fine. What happened?
THE OX KING
(angrily)
You’ve marked our home as next on the
Oolong’s list. That’s what you did!
The Ox King storms out of the room. Slamming the door
behind him.
MASTER ROSHI
(to Chi-Chi)
Could you excuse us Chi-Chi?
Chi-Chi gets up and departs. Roshi turns to Goku sternly.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
Well young man. You’ve lain a moral
dilemma on my hands.
81.
GOKU
I couldn’t just lay there and let that
thing snatch another girl.
MASTER ROSHI
But snatch another girl he did and you
did nothing but mark The Ox King as next
on it’s list.
Goku hangs his head in shame.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
So now we have to ask ourselves. Do we
stay and do battle with the Oolong or
continue our mission. The Ox King is
still willing to depart with his
Dragonball.
(beat)
But know this. If we save this town and
are unable to defeat The Nameks all we
will have accomplished is delaying the
inevitable. For this town will fall as
will the whole planet. As A Great Master
it is my decision to make -- but first
I’d like to hear your thoughts on this.
Goku.
GOKU
I say we stay and fight.
MASTER ROSHI
Yamcha.
YAMCHA
Look, ordinarily, I would have had that
ball and been outta her a long time ago.
But I’m with Goku on this one. I’m not
the kind of guy who likes to lay around
and let shit happen. I say we go down
there and kick the crap outta that thing!
MASTER ROSHI
Bulma.
BULMA
I’ve been doing some thinking. If this --
I can’t believe I’m gonna say this -- If
this prophesy is true. Isn’t there some
mention of a destroyer. The... uhh...
MASTER ROSHI
...Oozaru.
82.
BULMA
...right. The Oozaru. Now, according to
what you’ve told me, you guys have no
idea where it came from how it got here
etc. What’s to say that this thing isn’t
the Oozaru. I mean -- Oolong -- Oozaru?
This thing showed up three weeks ago just
after Goku’s grandfather was killed by a
beast. Coincidence or not.
Everybody ponders what Bulma just said. It’s clear that
they never looked at it like that before.
BULMA (CONT’D)
Who’s to say that this isn’t part of --
our mission. Part of what we are supposed
to do.
(beat)
I think we should fight.
Master Roshi paces back and forth thinking.
MASTER ROSHI
We will fight the Oolong. I just pray
that we haven’t doomed the world.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. THE VILLAGE OF OXFORD - DAY
Goku, Roshi, Bulma, and Yamcha stroll down the street
like gunslingers on their way to the OK Coral. The Ox
King, Chi-Chi and Suno are behind them. They walk to the
entrance of --
A MINE SHAFT.
THE OX KING
This is the entrance to Oolong’s lair.
Bulma and Yamcha lock and load their guns. Goku whips out
his powerpole.
THE OX KING (CONT’D)
Those weapons will do you no good against
the Oolong.
YAMCHA
Then what are we supposed to kill it
with? Bad intentions?
MASTER ROSHI
We must use the power of light to defeat
the beast.
83.
YAMCHA
Yeah but how much light are we gonna find
in a mine?
MASTER ROSHI
Sometimes you must know total darkness to
find the light within you.
YAMCHA
I think I got that same fortune cookie.
BULMA
I have something that might help.
She pulls out A METAL CANNISTER.
GOKU
What’s that?
BULMA
It’s a fuel cell from the Rough Rider.
Liquid nitrogen. I figure we could make
his insubstantial form substantial.
MASTER ROSHI
Brilliant Bulma. I never thought of that.
BULMA
I bet you will in the -- eh,hem! --
future.
MASTER ROSHI
Point made. Okay, let’s go.
The quartet of demon fighters enter the mine.
THE OX KING
Good luck to you all.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY
As they descend the shaft, the light becomes dimmer and
dimmer until THEY ARE IN DARKNESS. VWOOF! Bulma turns on
a powerful flashlight.
They see -- We see AN ANCIENT STARBUCKS, crumbled and
ruined. Then the ruins of A KRISPY KREME DONUT SHOP.
Human skeletons clutch fossilized donuts. Then A GAP and
a POTTERY BARN. They are in THE ANCIENT RUINS OF A
SHOPPING MALL.
BULMA
This place is giving me the creeps.
84.
They descend further and further. There is a sound. BATS.
They head on.
They enter A LARGE CAVERN that is dripping with water.
They slosh through black mud. Bat guano and --
HUMAN BODIES.
Bulma shines the light around. The floor is littered with
human bodies. Dried shrivelled, like ancient mummies.
Some of them still in colorful dresses.
YAMCHA
I think we just found the town’s
daughters.
MASTER ROSHI
It’s like he drained them of their entire
essence.
BULMA
Oh God, I think I’m gonna be sick.
Suddenly -- THAT BONE CHILLING SHRIEK! The light flickers
and dims. It starts to strobe like a bad fluorescent
bulb.
THAT SNIFFING NOISE. It seems like it’s coming from all
around them. THEY FORM A CIRCLE, BACK TO BACK circling.
MASTER ROSHI
Okay, you three try to subdue it. Then
when I say NOW! Get out of the way!
BULMA
And what are you going to be doing until
you say now?
MASTER ROSHI
Preparing to kill the beast.
YAMCHA
Yeah right like you were gonna levitate
that rock?
GOKU
QUIET! Don’t underestimate Master Roshi.
THE SHADOW PASSES THEM! Then -- APPEARS IN FRONT OF THEM!
HUGE. BILLOWY. FORMLESS. THE HINT OF A GROTESQUE PIG FACE
is barely evident in it’s shadowy form.
IT ATTACKS!
GOKU
85.
Lashes out at it with his powerpole and it HIT’S NOTHING.
A CLAW FORMS and becomes substantial. It SWINGS AT BULMA
and KNOCKS THE LIGHT FROM HER HAND.
ROSHI
BACKS UP INTO THE SHADOWS. As the light FLICKERS AND
STROBES creating an eerie STROBE LIGHT EFFECT. THE ACTION
SEEM LIKE CHAOS.
YAMCHA
BLASTS AT IT WITH HIS SHOTGUN! No effect. THE CLAW
BECOMES SUBSTANTIAL. WHAPPOW! It KNOCKS YAMCHA ACROSS THE
CAVE.
BULMA
Opens up the LIQUID NITROGEN. PSSSSSSSSST. She spray it
on the shadow and for a moment THAT AREA BECOMES
SUBSTANTIAL.
GOKU
Makes his move. WHAM! HE BLAST THE CREATURE WITH A
POWERFUL BLOW TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PORTION.
THE OOLONG LETS OUT A PIERCING SCREECH. Then it
DISAPPEARS AND REAPPEARS BEHIND THEM.
SWOOSH! POW!
IT SMACKS BULMA KNOCKING THE LIQUID NITROGEN OUT OF HER
HAND and sending her FLYING ACROSS THE CAVE landing
painfully on her back.
YAMCHA AND GOKU
BOTH LASH INTO THE SHADOWY FORM. PUNCHING SLASHING
KICKING AND HITTING -- NOTHING.
WHAP! POW! YAMCHA AND GOKU ARE HIT WITH DEVASTATING
BLOWS. THEN --
THE OOLONG
Sweeps over to --
BULMA
The shadowy form straddles her. IT’S HIDEOUS PIG LIKE
HEAD moves closer to her face then --
SUCKS!
86.
BULMA FIGHTS AND STRAINS. It’s clear she’s in great pain.
Then WE SEE. HER SPIRIT PULLING AWAY FROM HER BODY. She
continues to fight. HER FACE GRADUALLY STARTS TO SHRIVEL.
GOKU (CONT’D)
(to Yamcha)
Toss the canister!
YAMCHA
PICKS UP THE LIQUID NITROGEN CANNISTER.
GOKU
BRANDISHES HIS POWERPOLE.
GOKU (CONT’D)
HEY OOLONG!
The beast looks up just in time to see --
YAMCHA TOSS THE LIQUID NITROGEN AT IT AND --
GOKU (CONT’D)
POWERPOLE EXTEND!
THE POWERPOLE ELONGATES LIKE A ROCKET AND PUNCTURES THE
CANISTER.
KABOOM!
THE LIQUID NITROGEN EXPLODES IN THE CREATURES FACE.
TURNING A LARGE PART OF IT SUBSTANTIAL. THE CREATURE
FREEZES IN MOTION. THEN -- A VOICE RINGS OUT --
MASTER ROSHI (V.O.)
NOW!
They look up and see --
MASTER ROSHI ENVELOPED IN WHITE LIGHT. His shirt starts
to RIP OFF OF HIS BODY as POWERFUL MUSCLES BULGE BENEATH.
His chest are covered with AN ORNATE TATTOO --
THE SAME TATTOO WE SAW ON THE COLLECTOR’S CARD OF -- THE
NAMELESS. He stands in a familiar pose. Hands pulled to
his hips. KAME CATCH STYLE.
Between his palms is A GLOWING BALL OF WHITE ENERGY. HE
EMBRACES THE BALL --
GOKU
SNATCHES YAMCHA AND BULMA AND DIVES FOR COVER AS --
ROSHI
87.
UNLEASHES THE BALL.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
KAHMEHAMEHAAAAAAAAAA!
A TITANIC BLAST OF ENERGY EXPLODES FROM HIS HANDS. IT
ENVELOPS THE OOLONG -- AND DISINTEGRATES IT.
The Oolong is dead.
Goku stares in awe.
GOKU
The Kamehameha wave.
MASTER ROSHI
Collapses to the ground weakened from the blast.
Unfortunately the Kamehameha wave was so powerful that it
-- STARTS THE MINE TO CAVE IN.
YAMCHA
GOTTA GO NOW!
Roshi shrinks back to his old man size. Goku tosses him
over his shoulder and --
THEY RUN LIKE NOBODY’S BUSINESS.
THE MINE IS COLLAPSING AT THEIR HEELS.
GOKU
FASTER!
THEY TURN UP THE SPEED AS THE COLLAPSING TUNNELS GET
CLOSER. AND CLOSER.
THE ENTRANCE IS NEAR. DAYLIGHT UP AHEAD. CLOSER. CLOSER.
ROCKS START TO PELT THEM IN THE HEAD. ALMOST THERE AND --
THEY DIVE FOR SUNLIGHT JUST AS --
THE WHOLE MINE COLLAPSES BEHIND THEM.
EXT. THE VILLAGE OF OXFORD - DAY
They look behind them to see A TITANIC SINK HOLE THE SIZE
OF A SMALL TOWN FORM BEHIND THEM.
GOKU, BULMA AND YAMCHA
Look like they’ve been through hell. They turn around to
see -- THE TOWNS PEOPLE OF OXFORD all standing behind
them.
88.
THE OX KING
Is it...
Goku nods his head yes.
GOKU
The Oolong is dead.
A RAUCOUS CHEER GOES UP FROM THE CROWD. Celebration.
Jubilation. But Goku, Bulma, Yamcha and the Ox King look
on with sadness.
ROSHI IS IN BAD SHAPE. NEAR DEATH. The Ox King picks the
old man up in his arms like a child and carries him
through the crowd. They grow quiet in respect for the
injured master.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE VILLAGE OF OXFORD - NIGHT
A BLOCK PARTY IS IN FULL SWING as the citizens of Oxford
are free to enjoy the night once again.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE OX KING’S HOME - CHI-CHI’S ROOM - NIGHT
Roshi is unconscious in Chi-Chi’s bed. Everyone gathers
around. The Ox King is tending to Roshi.
THE OX KING
He will be fine after he regains his
strength. The Kamehameha Wave took a lot
out of him.
He turns to Goku.
THE OX KING (CONT’D)
I guess you are the Master now. The quest
is in your hands now young Goku.
Goku drops to his knee and takes Roshi’s hand. Everyone
takes this cue to adjourn to the next room.
GOKU
Master Roshi. What will I do now? How
will I face Piccolo?
89.
INT. THE OX KING’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME
YAMCHA
Wow, who’da thought the old coot had it
in him. That was by far the single most
badassed thing I’ve ever seen.
BULMA
The question is, how do we fight the
Nameks without him.
YAMCHA
We just fight. So far we’ve been kicking
ass and taking names. I mean after all --
all we have to do is run interference
while Goku goes down, calls up the
Dragon, makes a couple of wishes and BAM!
No more Nameks. No more Piccolo. Then you
and me take the Dragonballs create that
new energy you’ve been talkin’ about.
After that we get stinkin' dirty low-down
filthy rich and buy lots and lots of
STUFF.
He looks at Bulma affectionately. For the first time, he
lets his true feelings show.
YAMCHA (CONT’D)
Then Maybe, ah,... me and you could go
and do a little “hang out thing” at a
tropical island or something... whadaya
think?
Bulma smiles sweetly at Yamcha.
BULMA
(coyly)
Mr. Desert Bandit... Are you inviting me
to vacation with you?
YAMCHA
(smiles sexy)
Yeah, something like that.
Yamcha and Bulma stare at each other. The connection has
finally been made. Then --
SUNO
But Bulma. After Goku makes his wish, the
Dragonballs will disappear and scatter
all over the world again.
This SNAPS Bulma out of her romantic haze. Bulma didn’t
know this. She looks at Yamcha.
90.
BULMA
Did you know this?
Yamcha throws up his hands.
YAMCHA
Hey, I don’t follow this kind of stuff.
She turns to The Ox King.
BULMA
Is this true?
THE OX KING
I’m afraid so.
BULMA
(thoughtful)
That means, if this prophesy is indeed
true...
(pissed)
I’M SCREWED!
YAMCHA
Hey we still have a deal though -- right?
BULMA
OH SHUT UP!
(beat)
All this time. Somebody could have told
me.
At that moment. Goku walks into the room. He assumes the
mantel of leader...
GOKU
We should rest up. We leave first thing
in the morning.
Bulma glares at Goku.
ON SUNO. SHE SMILES.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE VILLAGE OF OXFORD - MORNING
Goku, Bulma and Yamcha are all packed up and ready to go.
The Ox King has given them all HORSES to ride.
THE OX KING
Continue East through the Bamboo forest
then across the Plane of Sighs. It will
lead you to the Dragon’s temple. We will
look after Sifu Roshi and Suno until you
get back. God’s speed to you all.
91.
Bulma hugs the Ox King, Chi-Chi and Suno. Yamcha gives
them the “wink and the Gun.” Chi-Chi gives Goku and extra
long hug and a kiss on the cheek.
CHI-CHI
Goodbye Goku. Until we meet again.
GOKU
Goodbye.
They head off down the road. The Ox King stands in the
middle of the road flanked by Suno and Chi-Chi, waving
goodbye. THE TOWNS PEOPLE BID THEM A HERO’S FAREWELL as
they ride off on their steeds.
ON SUNO. SHE STARES DARKLY FROM BEHIND THE OX KING’S LEG
Then smiles wickedly.
EXT. FOREST OF GREENWOOD - NIGHT
MONTAGE
WE SEE IMAGES OF THEM RIDING HARD THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL
GREEN FOREST. AT ONE POINT -- IT STARTS TO RAIN.
END MONTAGE
CUT TO:
INT. THE OX KING’S HOME - CHI-CHI’S ROOM - DAY
The Ox King and Chi-Chi are tending to Roshi.
THE OX KING
Chi-Chi have Suno bring more herbs from
the Pantry.
CHI-CHI
Okay.
Chi-Chi walks into the other room.
CHI-CHI (CONT’D)
Suno... Suno...
No answer. She walks around looking for the child. Then
she sees -- THE FRONT DOOR SWINGING OPEN. She steps
outside.
EXT. THE VILLAGE OF OXFORD - DAY
It’s raining outside. Chi-Chi looks around for Suno.
92.
CHI-CHI
Suno?
Suddenly -- VROOOOOOOM!
THE JET-LIKE AIRCRAFT ROARS OVERHEAD.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST OF GREENWOOD - DAY
Goku, Bulma and Yamcha are riding through the rain soaked
forest. Bulma is obviously cranky. She looks at Goku
irritated.
BULMA
So, at some point did you ever plan on
telling me that once you completed the
mission the Dragonballs would be gone?
GOKU
I thought you knew, too.
BULMA
If I knew, do you think I would have
agreed to help you so easily?
GOKU
Then why would I tell you?
BULMA
Oh, so it was your intention to dupe me
and Yamcha the whole time.
This flusters Goku. He’s caught off guard.
GOKU
No... well, yes... but... not really.
JESUS BULMA what difference does it make
now?
BULMA
(flippant)
None. No difference whatsoever. I just
wanted to know where I stood with you. I
thought we were friends. I mean it’s
still the end of the world right? Gotta
do what we gotta do.
Goku pulls up in front of Bulma and stops his horse.
Stern. Serious. Almost threatening.
GOKU
Are you having second thoughts, Bulma?
93.
BULMA
Nope.
GOKU
(raising his voice)
I need to know now! Are you having second
thoughts?
Bulma’s not one to be threatened.
BULMA
(narrowing her eyes)
Or what? What are you gonna do? If I did
have second thoughts -- Huh?
Yamcha rides between them.
YAMCHA
Hey you two! Forget it! Leave it alone.
We have a long ride ahead of us.
BULMA
Hmmph.
She spurs her horse and rides ahead. Yamcha follows her.
They ride side by side talking. Goku is in the back
watching. Seeds of mistrust have been planted. He grabs
the bag of Dragonballs and PULLS IT TIGHT.
EXT. FOREST OF GREENWOOD - NIGHT
Camp is set. The rain has stopped. THE MOON IS THREE
QUARTERS FULL. The campfire starts to die. THEY ALL SLEEP
APART FROM EACH OTHER. A dark uneasy sleep.
Through the darkness of the woods --
MAI RETURNS IN HER SUNO FORM.
She comes to each of them as they rest and --
MIMICS THE VOICES OF THE OTHER TWO.
On GOKU. HE HEARS MAI’S FAKE VOICES. A SECRETIVE
WHISPERING. PERFECT MIMICRY.
GOKU HEARS --
FAKE BULMA (O.S.)
Goku can’t be trusted. This whole Piccolo
nonsense is a ruse to get our
Dragonballs.
FAKE YAMCHA (O.S.)
Then we take the balls and leave.
94.
FAKE BULMA (O.S.)
No! He really believes all this prophesy
nonsense. He’d kill us before he let them
go.
FAKE YAMCHA (O.S.)
Not if I kill him first.
FAKE BULMA (O.S.)
Then take care of him. Kill him in his
sleep. And we’ll take the Dragonballs and
make a fortune.
(beat)
I love you Yamcha.
FAKE YAMCHA (O.S.)
I love you too.
Goku is shock to the core. He clutches the Dragonball bag
tightly.
CUT TO:
YAMCHA. HE HEARS MAI’S FAKE VOICES.
YAMCHA HEARS --
FAKE GOKU (O.S.)
Listen Bulma. The reason I didn’t tell
you is. I didn’t want Yamcha to find out.
I don’t think he can be trusted. All he
wants is the money.
FAKE BULMA (O.S.)
I know, Goku. I felt him out. I don’t
think he can be trusted either. This
mission is too important to risk having
him around.
FAKE GOKU (O.S.)
I hate to do it. But I’m gonna have to
kill him.
FAKE BULMA (O.S.)
I love you Goku. It’s always been you.
FAKE GOKU (O.S.)
I love you too Bulma.
YAMCHA GRITS HIS TEETH IN ANGER as we --
CUT TO:
BULMA IN HER TENT.
SHE HEARS --
95.
FAKE GOKU (O.S.) (CONT’D)
It’s clear she doesn’t believe in the
prophesy. All she cares about is her
fathers corporation. She’ll take off with
those balls first chance she gets. I
can’t let that happen.
FAKE YAMCHA (O.S.)
Then you know what we have to do. Cupcake
has to die. I’ll do it. She trusts me
more.
BULMA IS SHOCKED BEYOND BELIEF.
SHE QUIETLY PULLS HER PISTOL. A SHADOW APPEARS OUTSIDE
HER TENT. SHE AIMS THE PISTOL. A tiny voice rings out.
SUNO
(whispering)
Bulma are you in there?
Bulma opens the tent and Suno enters.
SUNO (CONT’D)
(looking frightened)
Bulma you have to leave. They’re gonna
kill you.
Bulma’s devastated. She looks like she’s about to cry.
They steal out of the tent quietly.
YAMCHA
RISES FROM HIS BLANKET. He pulls A KNIFE. He sneaks
quietly up to Goku’s blanket.
YAMCHA
(under his breath)
Lousy back stabbing bastards.
He RAISES THE BLADE and WHAPPOW! CATCHES A POWERPOLE TO
THE HEAD. YAMCHA BACK-FLIPS AND LEAPS INTO HIS WOLF-FANG
FISTS STANCE.
GOKU LEAPS INTO AND EAGLE’S CLAW STANCE.
GOKU
TRAITOR!
YAMCHA
IT’S TIME WE FINISHED WHAT WE STARTED IN
THE DESERT!
GOKU
LET’S DO IT! AAAAAAHHHH!
96.
THEY LUNGE AT EACH OTHER VIOLENTLY. THIS BATTLE IS
INTENSE. FILLED WITH RAGE AND BETRAYAL. IT’S A BATTLE TO
THE DEATH.
ON BULMA AND SUNO
Hiding in the surrounding wood. Bulma watches in horror
as the two former friends battle so viciously. Then she
sees it. THE BACKPACK WITH THE DRAGONBALLS. Left
unattended.
SUNO
Get the bag Bulma.
A QUICK AS A WINK. Bulma SNATCHES THE BAG AND TAKES OFF
with SUNO RIGHT BEHIND HER.
ON BULMA CLOSE. FRANTIC. BLAIR WITCH STYLE.
SHE BOLTS THROUGH THE FOREST BLINDLY. BRANCHES AND VINES
SCRATCHING HER FACE AND LIMBS. SUNO, UNSEEN, URGES HER ON
FROM BEHIND.
SUNO (O.C.) (CONT’D)
FASTER BULMA! THEY’RE COMING! TO YOUR
RIGHT! THEY’RE RIGHT BEHIND US!
BULMA TURNS UP THE SPEED. SHE’S NEVER BEEN MORE
FRIGHTENED. SUNO’S VOICE SLOWLY BEGINS TO CHANGE.
SUNO (O.C.) (CONT’D)
HURRY BULMA THEY’RE GOING TO KILL YOU!
(voice matures)
FASTER! BULMA! FASTER!
(husky woman’s voice)
FASTER, YOU SKANK!
Bulma turns around to find herself facing -- NOT SUNO --
but MAI.
BULMA
WHAT THE...
WHAPPOW! MAI SMACKS THE CRAP OUT OF BULMA KNOCKING HER TO
THE GROUND. She places her boot on Bulma’s throat and
presses. Bulma gasps for air.
MAI
What happened to that bullet with my name
on it Bitch?
(mimics Yamcha)
Huh, Cupcake?
(mimics Goku)
Are you having second thoughts?
(mimics Suno)
Are you gonna kill the monsters?
97.
BULMA TRIES TO SCREAM HER RAGE. ALL SHE CAN DO IS GRIT
HER TEETH IN RAGE!
VWOOSH! A BRIGHT LIGHT HITS THEM FROM ABOVE. It’s the
landing craft. Bulma and Mai LEVITATE INTO THE SHIP.
WHOOSH!
And it’s gone. Leaving behind --
THE LOCATOR.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST OF GREENWOOD - NIGHT
GOKU AND YAMCHA
ARE STILL DUKING IT OUT! Goku gets Yamcha with a POWERFUL
TAKE-DOWN MOVE AND LANDS ON TOP OF HIM.
THE CLOUDS PART AND THE MOON SHINES THROUGH.
GOKU RAISES HIS FIST ABOUT TO DELIVER A DEATH BLOW. For
a brief instant --
GOKU’S EYES GLOW BRIGHT RED.
HE SNARLS LIKE AN ANIMAL about to deliver the blow then --
HE STOPS HIMSELF. Rage is replaced by sadness. He lets
Yamcha up.
GOKU
(sadly )
I hope you two are happy.
He gets up and walks away.
YAMCHA
What did you mean by that?
But Goku keeps walking. Yamcha spits on the ground and
walks off the other way.
YAMCHA (CONT’D)
I hope you two are happy.
FADE OUT/IN:
INT. OIL TANKER - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
Bulma regains consciousness to find herself SUSPENDED IN
THE AIR. Her arms and legs are BOUND BY OILY TENTACLE
LIKE CABLES.
98.
She struggles to get free but the more she struggles THE
TIGHTER THEY PULL HER. She looks up. In front of her is --
A BATTALION OF HEIJI WARRIORS standing in formation.
Suddenly, THE HEIJI WARRIORS drop to their knees and bow
their heads as --
PILAF ENTERS THE ROOM. As he walks, he SLOWLY BEGINS TO
MORPH into a GREEN-SKINNED BAT EARED ALIEN. His true
NAMEK SELF. Bulma is shocked and horrified.
Pilaf is flanked by MAI also green in Namek form AND
SHOU, who pulls his mask off to reveal A FURRY WOLF’S
FACE. Pilaf CARESSES BULMA’S FACE. The Nameks are out of
the closet.
PILAF
So, Bulma Briefs. The great scientific
mind. The undying skeptic. Do you believe
in the prophesy now?
BULMA
(fighting to hide her horror)
I’m not afraid of you!
PILAF
That’s because you haven’t gotten to know
me very well. I assure you that in the
next few minutes that we spend together --
you will learn to be terrified of me.
Pilaf moves in closer smiling sadistically.
SLAM!
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. OPEN SEA - NIGHT
BULMA’S SCREAM
MORPHS INTO THE WHINE OF THE OIL TANKER SLOWLY MORPHING
INTO -- A MASSIVE, UGLY, ORGANIC LOOKING SPACECRAFT. IT
RISES OUT OF THE OCEAN AND TAKES OFF INTO THE SKY.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST OF GREENWOOD - MORNING
YAMCHA
Strolls along despondent and broken hearted.
YAMCHA
(grumbling to himself)
Friends! Load of crap that concept is.
99.
(MORE)
If the world doesn’t end I’m gonna make
sure I never pal-up with anyone ever
again -- especially not a chick!
HE SEES SOMETHING --
BULMA’S LOCATOR. Odd. He looks at her footsteps in the
dirt. They abruptly end at the locator.
He looks back in the direction that Goku went. Things
aren’t adding up. He fires up the locator. ALL SEVEN
BALLS ARE TOGETHER. AND MOVING FAST. What direction? He
looks up and SEES WHAT LOOKS LIKE --
A STORM CLOUD
Rocketing across the sky far too fast for a normal storm
cloud. He makes a decision. HE HEADS OFF IN THAT
DIRECTION.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE VILLAGE OF OXFORD - DAY
Goku rides solemnly into town. Beaten. A defeated man.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. THE OX KING’S HOME - CHI-CHI’S ROOM - DAY
The door is opened by The Ox-King. He says nothing. Goku
walks softly in and stands next to Master Roshi’s
unconscious form. The Ox King quietly closes the door
behind him.
Goku drops to his knee. He breaks down, placing his
forehead on Roshi’s hand.
GOKU
(sobbing)
Master Roshi, I failed. I failed Grandpa,
I failed you. I failed my friends.
(chokes)
I failed everything. Every decision I
made was the wrong one. I defied Grandpa
Gohan and he died for it. I should have
been there to protect him. Before he
died, he gave me one task to do. Protect
the Dragonballs -- and I couldn’t even do
that. And you -- It was because of me
that you’re hurt now. The fate of the
world fell into my hands. And I failed. I
don’t know what to do... I just don’t
know what to do.
A soft voice answers.
100.
YAMCHA (CONT'D)
VOICE
Follow your destiny.
Goku turns to find -- Chi-Chi standing behind him.
GOKU
I don’t know what it is anymore.
CHI-CHI
It’s with the Dragonballs, follow them.
GOKU
But it could mean having to kill my
friends, or dying at their hands?
CHI-CHI
If that is your destiny then so be it.
But I don’t believe it to be true. I
don’t believe anything but good can come
from you.
GOKU
But I’ve made a mess out of everything.
CHI-CHI
I believe that everything happens for a
reason. The things we do make us who we
are. And only when we’ve known total
darkness can we truly find the light. I
see a light in you Goku, that I’ve only
seen in two other men. My father, and
Master Roshi. You are so much stronger
than you think you are. You are a Master,
Goku the next Great Master.
Chi-Chi’s pep talk has a profound effect on Goku. We see
his spirit lifted with her words.
GOKU
(softly)
Thank you.
They look at each other. The bond between them has grown
stronger than ever. Their faces draw closer. Eyes close.
Lips part. Then --
GOKU (CONT’D)
I have to go.
Goku pulls himself straight. Strong. Ready to face
whatever may come to him.
GOKU (CONT’D)
Goodbye Chi-Chi.
CHI-CHI
Godspeed Goku.
101.
Goku STRIDES out of the door ready for battle. A SECOND
LATER -- He STRIDES back into the room LIKE A MAN ON A
MISSION. HE GRABS CHI-CHI in his arms, dips her like a
true Casanova and kisses her like there were no tomorrow.
He stands her back up and then --
THE AWKWARD TEEN RETURNS. They both stand there flushed
red.
GOKU
Wow... I’m sorry... I was like... uhh, I
don’t know what came over me... I was
just...
CHI-CHI
No... It’s okay... I mean. It was really
like... I mean...like... WOW...
Goku stumbles awkwardly for the door.
GOKU
Okay... so... Uh, I gotta go... Ummm...
CHI-CHI
Yeah... okay... uhh...okay...
Goku fumbles out the door and closes it behind him. ChiChi shuts her eye AND JUST BEAMS.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. FOREST OF GREENWOOD - DAY
Goku spurs his horse onward riding like the wind. THUNDER
AND LIGHTNING CRASH BEHIND HIM. This is a HERO MOMENT TO
THE NTH DEGREE.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. THE PLAIN OF SIGHS - NIGHT
Goku pushes his horse across the vast flat plain. THE
THUNDERSTORM IS RAGING. WATER PELTS HIM. LIGHTNING
ILLUMINATES HIM DRAMATICALLY.
SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - MORNING
The DRAGON’S TEMPLE RISES ABOVE THE HORIZON LIKE A
SANDSTONE MONOLITH. CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL --
102.
THE MASSIVE MOTHERSHIP
Hovering above the ancient temple. The grotesque organic
structure of the ship seems to pulse with a life of it’s
own.
GOKU
Enters frame and walks directly to the temple, powerpole
in hand. There’s no sneaking up on this thing. He’s ready
for battle.
EXT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
Goku walks up to the MASSIVE STONE ENTRANCE. This is ALL
TOO FAMILIAR. It is just like the video game. Goku knows
what’s ahead of him. He takes a deep breath and --
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS
RUSHES INTO THE TEMPLE -- It’s just like the game BUT
REAL. IT’S ON! Goku leaps and jumps over traps, avoiding
blades that spring out of walls, hops over trap doors
cleverly disguised as floor tiles, HE RUNS UP THE SIDE OF
THE WALLS to avoid collapsible floors. He rounds a
corner. Then another corner. Then another and he sees --
SUNO
Standing in the middle of the corridor like one of the
two little girls in “The Shining.”
GOKU
Suno! What are you doing here?
Suno/Mai stretches her arms out in the “come hug me”
fashion of children.
SUNO
(innocent plaintive)
Goku, I’m scared. Please help me.
GOKU
Don’t worry Suno, I’m here.
Goku puts the powerpole on the ground and walks toward
Suno. Suddenly --
SHWOOOP! A TRAP DOOR OPENS BENEATH HIM. GOKU FALLS INTO
THE SHAFT TO THE SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER.
GOKU (CONT’D)
Gotta remember.
103.
Goku slides around one corner. Then the next. He begins
to count.
GOKU (CONT’D)
One thousand one, one thousand two, one
thousand three...
Goku pulls himself to his feet sliding down the shaft
like a SNOWBOARDER, counting a PERFECT 15 SECONDS.
GOKU (CONT’D)
One thousand thirteen, one thousand
FOURTEEN ONE THOUSAND FIFTEEN...
HE REACHES THE END OF THE SHAFT AND LEAPS PERFORMING A
BEAUTIFUL BACK SOMERSAULT AND...
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - SACRIFICIAL CHAMBER -
CONTINUOUS
STICKS THE LANDING JUST INCHES FROM ONE OF SEVERAL METAL
SPIKES sprouting from the floor.
GOKU
(closing his eyes in
reverence)
Thank you Kal.
Ancient skeletons litter the floor. Some still impaled on
the spikes. This was obviously a sacrificial chamber.
Goku looks up. THERE IS NO CEILING. But the sky is not
visible. Just the underside of the alien craft. A FEMALE
voice rings out.
SUNO (O.S.)
HELP ME GOKU.
Goku turns. He looks up. There standing on A BALCONY of
sorts is -- MAI. She laughs wickedly.
A moment later. SHOU joins her on the balcony WITH BULMA
AND YAMCHA bound by some alien cord.
BULMA
Goku. We were duped. Yamcha and I never
said the things you heard.
YAMCHA
It was that little hoe right there.
Yamcha nods toward Mai.
PILAF (O.S.)
Ah, yes. Duped you were. In more ways
than one.
104.
PILAF enters the balcony in NAMEK FORM. Goku recognizes
the form instantly from his years of playing Dragonball.
GOKU
(disgusted)
Namek-Jin.
PILAF
You were duped into thinking you were --
The...
(condescending)
...“Last of the Great Masters.”
Goku grits his teeth in hatred.
PILAF (CONT’D)
What did you think? -- That you were
human?
(laughs)
You are Saiyan. Your true name is
Kakarot. You are from a race of
conquerors. Saiyans and Nameks have been
destroying pathetic planets like this for
millenniums.
Pilaf pulls out Goku’s POWERPOLE. He holds it up admiring
it’s workmanship.
GOKU
My powerpole!
PILAF
(condescending)
Is this what you were going to use to
defeat us?
He hands the pole to Shou, who promptly BREAKS IT IN HALF
and tosses the pieces to the ground. Goku looks sick.
PILAF (CONT’D)
It’s time for you to put away childish
things young Kakarot. It’s time for you
to grow up and face your destiny.
GOKU
My destiny is to DESTROY YOU!
PILAF
Oh, I think not my young Saiyan warrior.
Your destiny is to destroy Earth! You are
the destroyer, Oozaru. You are the
sleeper. It is time for the sleeper to
awake.
Yamcha and Bulma are shocked. Goku shakes his head no.
Unbelieving. Defiant.
105.
GOKU
I DON’T BELIEVE YOU!
PILAF
Skeptical are you, then think back. Where
did you come from? Who were your parents?
Did anyone tell you?
GOKU
I was an abandoned child. My Grandfather
adopted me.
PILAF
He FOUND you!
PILAF raises A DEVICE -- ZAPS GOKU WITH A BLAST OF
ENERGY.
GOKU SEEMS TO GO INTO A TRANCE. Then --
FWOOSH FLASHBACK.
EXT. MOUNT PAOZU - DUSK
Gohan is planting sprouts in his garden when --
A METEOR STREAKS ACROSS THE SKY AND --
KABOOM!
CRASHES INTO THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. Gohan rushes over
to the crash sight. He looks up 150 feet above him.
Something FALLS FROM THE FLAMING IMPACT CRATER in the
side of the mountain and LANDS INTO THE ROCKS BELOW.
Gohan walks over and inspects what fell.
AN INFANT CHILD
Gohan picks up the child then looks up at the smoking
meteor in the side of the mountain. The child is totally
unharmed. It’s baby Goku with spiky hair and all. He
smiles At Gohan as we --
FWOOSH! FLASH BACK TO SCENE
GOKU
I don’t believe you!
PILAF
No? Then think back to your Grandfather’s
death.
Pilaf zaps him with the device again.
106.
FWOOSH!
FLASHES BACK
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - GOHAN’S STUDY - NIGHT
Grandpa Gohan is in his study going over ancient
manuscripts. THE FULL MOON SHINES THROUGH THE WINDOW.
SUDDENLY
Goku enters the study, his eyes GLOWING RED just like
they did when he was fighting Yamcha. But this time GOKU
MORPHS INTO A HIDEOUS MAN-SIZE VERSION OF THE OOZARU. HE
LASHES OUT AT GRANDPA GOHAN!
KAL AND WULAN rush into the room. OOZARU bashes them with
one stroke of his paw knocking them unconscious. He turns
his full attention to Gohan.
GRANDPA GOHAN
GOKU NOOO!
FWOOSH FLASH OF WHITE
BACK TO THE PRESENT.
Goku is floored by this revelation. He drops to his knees
with his hands over his ears. Not wanting to hear any
more.
GOKU
No. It can’t be true!
PILAF
Yeeeeessss! You remember, now, don’t you,
Kakarot! You were sent here as a sleeper
to await your master just as your
predecessor was sent one thousand years
ago.
GOKU
(pure mental agony)
NOOOOO!
A DEEP HUMMING NOISE IS HEARD. Overhead -- THE SPACE
CRAFT BEGINS TO SLOWLY SPIN AWAY FROM THE TOP OF THE PIT
REVEALING THE SKY.
PILAF
The Oozaru comes to maturity on it’s 18th
year. The full Moon brings it out.
FWOOSH! FLASHBACK
107.
EXT. PAOZU FORREST - NIGHT
GOKU IS ASLEEP BY THE TRACTOR WHEEL. THE CLOUDS PART AND
THE FULL MOON REVEALS IT’S SELF!
FWOOSH! FLASHBACK
EXT. FOREST OF GREENWOOD
GOKU AND YAMCHA ARE FIGHTING. THE FULL MOON COMES OUT.
GOKU’S EYES FLASH RED!
FWOOSH!
BACK TO THE PRESENT
Goku is shaking his head no.
GOKU
NO, NO, NO, IT CAN’T BE!
Pilaf gleefully continues.
PILAF
But when the moon eclipses the sun, and
THIS WORLD ALIGNS WITH OURS. You will
become THE GREAT OOZARU. YOUR TRUE FORM
AND YOU WILL REMAIN THAT WAY UNTIL YOU
HAVE LAIN WASTE TO THIS PATHETIC ROCK
CALLED EARTH.
THE OIL TANKER HAS CLEARED THE TOP OF THE PIT. THE SKY IS
VISIBLE --
THE SUN IS NEAR ECLIPSE. THE MOON JUST STARTING TO MOVE
IN FRONT OF IT.
GOKU LOOKS UP
HIS EYES GLOW RED!
PILAF (CONT'D)
YOU KILLED YOUR GRANDFATHER. JUST AS YOU
WILL KILL ALL OF MANKIND! STARTING WITH
YOUR FRIENDS HERE.
Shou pushes Bulma and Yamcha into the pit. They narrowly
escape from being impaled.
PILAF (CONT’D)
Welcome, young Kakarot -- to your
destiny.
Goku lets out a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.
108.
GOKU
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
PILAF PRODUCES ALL SEVEN DRAGONBALLS.
PILAF
Now it is time for me to meet my Destiny.
Pilaf and company turn and depart.
THE SUN
IS ALMOST IN FULL ECLIPSE
THE SKY GROWS DARK.
GOKU
STARTS TO TREMBLE. HIS MUSCLES START TO BULGE, RIPPING AT
HIS SHIRT. HE BEGINS TO GROW! PAINFULLY!
GOKU
AIIIIEEEEEEEE!
YAMCHA
FIGHT IT GOKU!
FANGS GROW FROM HIS MOUTH. HE BECOMES THE MONSTER OF HIS
NIGHTMARES.
YAMCHA GRABS BULMA AND PUSHES HER BEHIND HIM.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - SHRINE - SAME
Pilaf and company enter the Shrine of the Eternal Dragon.
The alter is large and ornate, carved with ancient
hieroglyphics.
CUT TO:
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - PIT - SAME
THE MOON IS IN IT’S FINAL STAGES TO FULL ECLIPSE. THEN IT
HAPPENS. THE DARKNESS.
GOKU MORPHS COMPLETELY INTO OOZARU. HE STANDS SOME
FIFTEEN FEET TALL! HE STRETCHES OUT HIS POWERFUL ARMS AND
LETS OUT AN EAR SPLITTING ROAR!
Then he sets his eyes on Yamcha and Bulma. HE SWATS AT
THEM. THEY DIVE OUT OF THE WAY. HE SWATS AT THEM AGAIN.
109.
THEY DIVE. BUT OOZARU’S CLAW TEARS INTO THE WALL RIPPING
OUT A HUGE CHUNK OF STONE!
The rubble PELTS YAMCHA AND BULMA dazing them. Slowing
them down just long enough for OOZARU TO GRAB THEM BOTH
IN EACH HAND.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - SHRINE
The Dragonballs are all in place. Pilaf steps to the
Shrine and raises his arms dramatically.
PILAF
ETERNAL DRAGON ARISE! I EVOKE THEE
THE GROUND SHAKES. THE DRAGON IS COMING.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - PIT - SAME
YAMACHA AND BULMA
Are still in the clutches of the beast. THEY STRUGGLE IN
VAIN. OOZARU STARTS TO SQUEEZE. THEY ARE GETTING CRUSHED.
Yamcha looks over at Bulma. And with his last few
breaths he says.
YAMCHA
I love you.
Bulma looks at him her eyes tearing.
BULMA
Cool.
THEN -- KABOOOOOOM! The side of the pit EXPLODES INWARDS.
OOZARU
DROPS YAMCHA AND BULMA. He turns around to the GAPING
HOLE IN THE WALL AND SEES --
MASTER ROSHI
BUFFED OUT IN FULL KAMEHAMEHA MODE
MASTER ROSHI
GOKU! STOP! THIS IS NOT YOUR DESTINY.
ROSHI BLASTS OOZARU WITH HIS OWN MENTAL ENERGY
110.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
Remember Goku. Remember.
THE BEAST REARS IT’S HEAD BACK IN PAIN.
FWOOSH!
FLASHBACK
INT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - NIGHT
GOKU HAS MORPHED INTO THE BEAST. He swats Kal and Wulan.
THEN HE ATTACKS GOHAN. He RAISES HIS CLAWS TO DELIVER A
DEATH BLOW. --
Then stops.
He can’t do it.
The creature rushes back into the woods in shame.
GRANDPA GOHAN
Goku, I knew you couldn’t do it.
Grandpa Gohan RUSHES to his study. There he finds --
MAI AND SHOU. Standing over the dead bodies of Kal and
Wulan. They angle their weapons at Gohan.
FWOOSH!
BACK TO THE PRESENT
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - PIT - SAME
THE BEAST’S FACE SOFTENS. It sets Yamcha and Bulma back
down and then slowly but surely --
MORPHS BACK INTO GOKU
THE ECLIPSE PASSES. THE SUN COMES BACK OUT. Goku kneels
on the floor of the Pit naked. Roshi walks over and
places an arm around his shoulder.
MASTER ROSHI
You were sent here as a destroyer to
serve your master. But your master isn’t
Piccolo. Your master was a brilliant
young Archeologist named Gohan who went
with me on a similar search for
Dragonballs 1000 years ago and who
defeated Piccolo right in this temple.
111.
GOKU
Grandpa was the Archeologist? I never
knew he was so old.
MASTER ROSHI
Learning to harness the power of light
gives the practitioner great longevity.
GOKU
And you. You were The Nameless?
MASTER ROSHI
I was a lot more serious back in those
days. But I recognized a Master in your
Grandfather just as I recognized it in
you. Your destiny is as a savior young
Goku.
Roshi reaches a LARGE DUFFLE BAG. He pulls out A VARIETY
OF GUNS AND WEAPONS and -- A PAIR OF PANTS.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
You may need these.
Goku puts the pants on. Bulma and Yamcha join him. Bulma
picks up a pair of TWIN AUTOMATICS. YAMCHA TWO SHORT
SWORDS.
GOKU
Master Roshi, I thought that you were
near death.
MASTER ROSHI
Oh, I wasn’t as bad off as I lead you all
to believe. I had to fool that little
witch, now didn’t I.
BULMA
You knew about Suno all along?
MASTER ROSHI
Ho,ho! You gotta get up early in the
morning to fool and old coot like me.
YAMCHA
Why didn’t you tell Goku and us about his
destiny from the beginning if you knew.
MASTER ROSHI
One cannot be told what path to walk to
reach his destiny. One must find the path
and walk it himself.
YAMCHA
And you were willing to risk the fate of
the world on your faith that Goku would
find that right path?
112.
Master Roshi looks at Goku and smiles.
MASTER ROSHI
Yep. Cause I’m usually right about these
things. Now Goku has one last path to
walk.
(looks at Goku)
Are you ready to walk it Young Master?
Goku stands up shirtless. Muscles bulging. Fire in his
eye.
GOKU
I’M READY!
POW!
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - SHRINE - DAY
THE FINAL SHOWDOWN
THE GROUND BEGINS TO SHAKE. PILAF AND CREW FIGHT TO KEEP
THEIR BALANCE. THEN -- A GREEN MIST APPEARS. It grows
larger -- AND LARGER -- until it starts to TAKE FORM --
THE FORM OF A MASSIVE DRAGON! IT IS BOTH BEAUTIFUL AND
TERRIBLE. THE BEAST IS PURE SPIRIT. IT LOOKS AT PILAF
WITH BURNING RED EYES. It speaks with and impossibly LOW
DEEP VOICE.
ETERNAL DRAGON
What is your wish?
Pilaf smiles wickedly.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - LABYRINTH
GOKU AND TEAM SPRINT THROUGH THE LABYRINTH OF CORRIDORS.
A PHALANX OF HEIJI WARRIORS
BAR THEIR WAY TO THE TEMPLE.
BULMA
WHIPS OUT TWO PISTOLS. SHE STARTS BLASTING.
YAMCHA
113.
WHIPS OUT HIS SHORT SWORDS AND LEAPS INTO THE PACK OF
HEIJI WARRIORS SLICING AND DICING LIKE A HUMAN FOOD
PROCESSOR.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE - SHRINE
ANDROID PARTS EXPLODE INTO THE TEMPLE. MAI SHOU AND PILAF
TURN AND FIND THEMSELVES FACING --
GOKU, ROSHI, BULMA AND YAMCHA. STRAPPED AND READY TO
ROCK. Goku addresses Pilaf!
GOKU
Looks like you won’t have your destroyer
to help you this time, Namek!
PILAF
I don’t need him, I have someone better.
CLOSE ON --
THE ALTER
THE SEVEN DRAGONBALLS VANISH! The wish has been made. A
BLACK VOID FORMS. ALL LIGHT DIMS. Then --
KABOOM!
AN EXPLOSION OF PURE ENERGY ROCKS THE TEMPLE. When the
smoke clears, we see standing on the alter. In full glory --
PICCOLO THE DEMON KING OF NAMEK.
Piccolo has GREEN SKIN Bat-like ears, and antenna. He
wears A WHITE TURBAN OF SORTS and A FLOWING WHITE CAPE.
Mai, Shou, and Pilaf drop to their knees in reverence to
their king.
PILAF (CONT’D)
My lord.
Piccolo looks up slowly then smiles. He stretches out his
arms. AND LEVITATE IN THE AIR CAPE FLAPPING DRAMATICALLY.
He doesn’t have eyes just TWO CAVITIES WITH BURNING FIRE
BEHIND THEM.
PICCOLO
I don’t need the destroyer this time
around. I AM A GOD!
MASTER ROSHI HITS PICCOLO WITH A POWERFUL BLAST OF
ENERGY. IT BARELY HAS AN EFFECT ON HIM.
114.
PICCOLO (CONT’D)
It took six masters to stop me before
what use is one.
HE SHOOTS A BLAST OF ENERGY OUT OF HIS EYES.
GOKU, BULMA, ROSHI AND YAMCHA LEAP IN DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS TO AVOID THE BLAST.
The blast OPENS UP A FISSURE SO DEEP THAT YOU CAN SEE HOT
MAGMA DOWN BELOW.
GOKU LEAPS INTO A FIGHTING POSITION.
GOKU
MAKE THAT -- TWO MASTERS, DEMON!
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
MAI AND SHOU ATTACK.
YAMCHA AND BULMA TAKE THEM ON.
PILAF MAKES A BREAK FOR THE EXIT.
YAMCHA AND SHOU GO AT IT WITH BLISTERING, POWERFUL
MARTIAL ARTS COMBINATIONS!
BULMA
RUSHES MAI WITH BOTH GUNS BLAZING.
MAI
CARTWHEELS OUT OF THE WAY, DROPS INTO A SPLIT AND WHIPS
OUT -- BULMA’S OLD PISTOL.
MAI
(licking her lips)
I’m going to just -- love killing you
with your own gun.
BULMA
Then that’s gonna be unrequited love,
cause it ain’t happening bitch!
BULMA LEAPS UP AND STARTS BLASTING! MAI LEAPS UP AND
STARTS BLASTING AT POINT BLANK RANGE!
LIKE THE “GUN KATA” FROM THE MOVIE EQUILIBRIUM, THEY DUCK
AND BLOCK EACH OTHERS PISTOLS LIKE FENCERS. CHINK! CLINK!
POW! CHANK! POW! CHINK! CLANK! PISTOLS CLANGING, ROUNDS
FIRING. THIS IS SOME COOL SHIT!
PICCOLO
115.
UNLEASHES ANOTHER BLAST OF ENERGY! KABOOM! THE EARTH
SHAKES! ANOTHER FISSURE OPENS!
GOKU
LEAPS AND SPINS OUT OF THE WAY LIKE A PING-PONG BALL. HE
LANDS CLOSE TO PICCOLO. BUT --
PICCOLO
HAS HIM IN HIS SIGHT! HE IS ABOUT TO HIT GOKU WITH
ANOTHER ENERGY BLAST -- VWOOOOOSH
ROSHI
HITS PICCOLO WITH AN ENERGY BLAST OF HIS OWN, THROWING
THE DEMON SLIGHTLY OFF BALANCE. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY
THAT GOKU NEEDED.
HE LASHES INTO PICCOLO WITH A BLINDING COMBINATION!
PICCOLO COUNTERS. THEN GOKU. BACK AND FORTH IT GOES.
PUNCH! KICK! PARRY! ROUNDHOUSE! LEG SWEEP! JUMP! DOUBLE
KICK! BACKFIST! FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL THE COMBATANT’S
HANDS AND FEET ARE A BLUR.
PICCOLO HAS HAD ENOUGH
HE THROWS HIS ARMS OUTWARD! A BLAST OF ENERGY EXPLODES
FROM HIM LIKE A TACTICAL NUKE!
GOKU, ROSHI, MAI, BULMA, YAMCHA AND SHOU
ARE ALL BLOWN BACKWARDS FROM THE CONCUSSION!
THE TEMPLE SHAKES AND STARTS TO CRUMBLE.
MORE FISSURES OPEN UP.
HOT MAGMA BUBBLES BELOW PAINTING THE SCENE A HELLISH RED!
SOLID GROUND IS AT A PREMIUM NOW AS PARTS OF THE FLOOR
START TO CRUMBLE TO THE EARTH’S CORE.
PICCOLO
LEVITATES IN THE AIR ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, BATHED IN RED
ENERGY.
PICCOLO
Did you think you could just fight me
with hands and feet. I AM A GOD! Only the
power of a God can kill me!
HE SHOOTS ENERGY FROM HIS EYES AT --
116.
GOKU
WHO LEAPS AND BOUNDS THE EVER WIDENING FISSURES AVOIDING
THE BLASTS.
THE FLOOR OF THE TEMPLE IS STARTING TO RESEMBLE A MAZE OF
CRAGGY PILLARS. SOME OF THEM CRUMBLE INTO THE MOLTEN
EARTH BELOW.
ROSHI
UNLEASHES HIS KAMEHAMEHA WAVE. WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING --
PICCOLO
BLOCKS IT WITH ONE OUTSTRETCHED HAND AND -- PUSHES IT
BACK TO ROSHI!
KABOOOOM!
ROSHI SLAMS INTO THE TEMPLE WALL. BOULDERS START TO
CRUMBLE AROUND HIM. Roshi is done. There is no more fight
left in him.
SHOU
IS BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF YAMCHA BY SHEER POWER ALONE.
YAMCHA
IS PISSED. HE LEAPS BACK AND DROPS INTO A FAMILIAR POSE.
YAMCHA
WOLF FANG FISTS!
HE ROCKETS TOWARD SHOU LIKE A HUMAN COMET!
SHOU
RUSHES RIGHT TOWARD YAMCHA. IT’S like TWO FREIGHT TRAINS
ON A COLLISION COURSE! BOOM! THEY COLLIDE!
YAMCHA’S
HANDS ARE A BLUR. WHAPPAPPOWBOOFPAPPOWWHIPPOW! SHOU TAKES
NEARLY 20 UNANSWERED BLOWS!
PICCOLO
UNLEASHES ANOTHER BLAST OF ENERGY AT GOKU JUST AS --
YAMCHA
PERFORMS A VICIOUS, DOUBLE ROTATION, SPINNING WHEEL KICK
AND KAPOOOW! KICKS THE HOLY HELL OUT OF --
117.
SHOU
WHO GOES SAILING RIGHT INTO THE PATH OF PICCOLO’S BLAST!
PFFFFFT! THE NINJA BEAST IS VAPORIZED LIKE SPIT ON A HOT
IRON!
A SMALL PART OF THE ENERGY HITS --
GOKU
AND SENDS HIM CRASHING TO THE FLOOR.
CRAAAAAAACK!
THE FLOOR OPENS UP ALL AROUND HIM AND CRUMBLES AWAY
LEAVING GOKU STRANDED ON A CRAGGY PILLAR OF GROUND NO
MORE THAN FOUR FEET IN DIAMETER.
THIS IS LIKE GOKU’S TRAINING ON THE BALANCE POSTS.
THE PILLAR WOBBLES UNSTABLY THREATENING TO TOPPLE INTO
THE INFERNO BELOW.
GOKU IS TRAPPED.
BULMA
HAS THE DROP ON MAI. SHE RAISES HER PISTOL TO SHOOT AND --
CLICK! -- empty. Shit.
MAI
RAISES HER PISTOL GRINNING SADISTICALLY
BULMA
DOES A LEAPING DOUBLE KICK. KICKING THE PISTOL OUT OF
MAI’S HAND THEN KICKING MAI IN THE CHIN.
SUPER SLOW MOTION
MAI
FLIPS IN THE AIR from the impact of the kick.
BULMA
Carried by the equilibrium of her kick -- FLIPS IN THE
AIR.
THE PISTOL
FLIPS IN THE AIR.
WE SEE --
118.
BULMA, MAI AND THE PISTOL SPINNING IN THE AIR AT THE SAME
TIME.
BULMA
SNATCHES THE PISTOL FROM MID-AIR AND -- POW! POW! POW!
CAPS OFF THREE SHOTS THAT CATCH --
MAI
IN MID FLIP AND SENDS HER SAILING OFF THE LEDGE AND INTO
THE MOLTEN LAVA BELOW!
MAI
AAAIIIIIIEEEEEEEEE!
PSSSSSSSSST Mai’s gone in a PUFF OF STEAM.
NORMAL SPEED
BULMA lands on solid floor. She looks at her favorite
pistol and smiles.
BULMA
(to her gun)
Welcome home baby.
YAMCHA AND ROSHI RUSH TO HER SIDE. THEY ALL LOOK UP TO
SEE.
PICCOLO
HOVERING ABOVE THEM AND --
GOKU
Stranded on his unstable island.
PICCOLO
Starts to FORM A BALL OF ENERGY between his palms. IT
GLOWS A HELLISH RED AND GETS LARGER AND BRIGHTER!
PICCOLO
And now Kakarot, for your betrayal. You
will watch your friends die. Then you
will watch your world die. You will bear
witness to the destruction of EVERYTHING
YOU WERE, EVERYTHING YOU ARE AND
EVERYTHING YOU WILL BECOME!
AND THEN IT HAPPENS.
ON GOKU
TIME SEEMS TO STAND STILL. WE HEAR HIS THOUGHTS.
119.
GOKU (V.O.)
Everything I was...
He looks over at --
ROSHI.
We hear his voice from the past.
MASTER ROSHI (V.O.)
Those who cannot remember the past are
condemned to repeat it.
GOKU (V.O.)
...Everything I am...
He looks at --
YAMCHA
Yamcha’s voice comes back to him.
YAMCHA (V.O.)
You can’t live in the past and you’re not
promised a future...
GOKU (V.O.)
...and everything I will become.
He looks at --
BULMA
Bulma’s voice comes back to him.
BULMA (V.O.)
I only think about the future.
ON GOKU
FWOOSH!
FLASHBACK!
EXT. GOHAN’S COTTAGE - MORNING
We are once again in that beautiful courtyard on a
perfect day. Except it now looks heavenly -- surreal.
Gohan and Goku have just finished training.
GRANDPA GOHAN
What is the pinnacle of martial arts
excellence?
120.
GOKU
To achieve SUPREME BALANCE.
GRANDPA GOHAN
How do you achieve supreme balance?
GOKU
To understand the balance of time.
GRANDPA GOHAN
And how do you begin to understand the
balance of time?
Goku thinks about it. He’s stumped.
GOKU
I don’t know? Tell me Grandpa.
GRANDPA GOHAN
I cannot tell you because it cannot be
taught. It can only be understood. And
that will come with time. But when you do
understand it, you will be faster and
stronger than anyone or anything in the
universe.
FWOOSH!
BACK TO THE NIGHTMARE OF THE DRAGON’S TEMPLE
GOKU
Looks over at his three friends huddled together facing
the end of all things. And he gets it.
GOKU
(thinking out loud)
The present is made complete by the past
and the future! That is the supreme
balance of time.
GOKU STANDS TALL
HIS PALMS BEGIN TO GLOW WITH A WHITE LIGHT!
HE PRESSES HIS PALMS DOWN AND --
THE PILLAR STOPS ROCKING!
PICCOLO’S
BALL OF ENERGY HAS REACHED CRITICAL MASS! HE SHOOTS THE
ENERGY BALL AT OUR HEROS!
PICCOLO
DIEEEEEEEEEEE!
121.
THE ENERGY BALL ROCKETS TOWARD BULMA, ROSHI AND YAMCHA AT
THE SPEED OF LIGHT!
GOKU
LAUNCHES HIMSELF FROM HIS PERCH!
VWOOOOOMP!
TIME SEEMS TO STOP.
There is no motion. Total stillness. Total quiet. Only
TWO THINGS ARE MOVING --
THE BALL OF ENERGY
SLOWLY STREAKING TOWARDS OUR HEROS AND --
GOKU
RUSHING TO INTERCEPT IT.
GOKU LANDS IN FRONT OF HIS FRIENDS and in PERFECT KAMECATCH FORM HE --
CATCHES THE BALL OF ENERGY
HE EMBRACES THE BALL. THE RED ENERGY TURNS TO A BRIGHT
BLUE/WHITE ENERGY!
NORMAL SPEED
HE THROWS THE BALL OF ENERGY BACK AT PICCOLO SCREAMING
GOKU
KAMEHAMEHAAAAAAAAAAA!
For one brief second Piccolo looks in shock and horror
then --
THE ENERGY HITS PICCOLO.
KABOOM!
PICCOLO
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
HE SCREAMS IN HORROR AS THE STREAM OF ENERGY STRIPS HIS
SKIN OFF -- THEN HIS FLESH -- UNTIL HE IS A SCREAMING
SKELETON AND THEN --
KABOOOOM!
HIS SPIRIT EXPLODES LIKE A 15 MEGATON BOMB.
PICCOLO IS DONE!
122.
But so is the Temple.
THE CEILING CRUMBLES REVEALING THE SKY
THE MAJORITY OF THE FLOOR CRUMBLES INTO THE MOLTEN EARTH!
THE CHUNK OF FLOOR OUR HEROS ARE ON, SLOWLY STARTS TO
SINK INTO THE BURNING HOT MAGMA!
They’re dead for sure.
They stare at each other bittersweet emotions on their
faces.
YAMCHA
Well at least we saved the world. Huh?
(beat)
Sure would have like to have seen West
City with Bulma.
THE CHUNK OF FLOOR TILTS AND STARTS TO SINK FASTER. THEY
HOLD HANDS.
BULMA
(to Roshi)
Sure would like to see that Flying cloud
of yours.
Roshi smiles
MASTER ROSHI
Good idea Bulma.
SUDDENLY -- THUNDER AND LIGHTNING CRASH AS --
A ROILING CLOUD OF GAS AND ELECTRICITY STREAKS DOWN FROM
THE HEAVENS AND PARKS ITSELF RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
(to Goku)
Only the pure of heart can ride the
Nimbus. I got sneaking suspicion that
it’s not them.
(point to Bulma and Yamcha)
And it sure as hell ain’t me.
GOKU
MAKES THE LEAP OF FAITH AND JUMPS ON THE CLOUD! IT
SUPPORTS HIM! HE GRABS ROSHI’S HAND WHO GRABS YAMCHA’S
WHO GRABS BULMA’S JUST AS --
THE CHUNK OF FLOOR SINKS INTO THE LAVA LIKE THE TITANIC!
VWOOSH
123.
THE FLYING NIMBUS CARRIES OUR HEROS TO SAFETY.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE PLAIN OF SIGHS - DAY
Goku lands the Nimbus on the plain several miles from the
Temple, NEAR THE HORSES. They watch in awe as -- THE
TEMPLE OF THE ETERNAL DRAGON SINKS INTO THE EARTH.
They look to the sky. The MOTHERSHIP ROCKETING OUT TO
SPACE. Goku does ONE LAST KAMEHAMEHA WAVE.
He SHOOTS IT INTO THE SKY. AND --
KABOOOM! THE MOTHERSHIP IS DESTROYED! Firey debris rains
from the sky like fireworks.
And it’s over. The world is saved.
YAMCHA
Guess that’s it for the Dragonballs?
ROSHI
Oh, no not by a long shot. They’ve been
scattered across the planet once again.
GOKU
(to Bulma)
If you want, I’ll help you look for them.
Bulma thinks about it.
BULMA
Naw, the stones should be lost. Forgotten
about. They should become a myth, a
bedtime story to tell children.
YAMCHA
What about your company?
BULMA
It will survive. I should have learned
from my father not to go chasing stones
that can kill you. Guess I learned from
my past.
Yamcha embraces Bulma.
YAMCHA
Well I can see a future with you,
cupcake.
124.
BULMA
Will you stop calling me that. I hate
that name. You are such an ass. I swear
to God sometimes...
YAMCHA
Ahhh, shut up!
He snatches her by the arm and yanks her close. They
kiss. Long and hard. A little too hard. Hey, this is a PG13 Movie here!
MASTER ROSHI
Get a room already!
Roshi turns to Goku.
MASTER ROSHI (CONT’D)
So, what are you going to do young Master
Goku?
Goku smiles.
GOKU
Which way’s back to Oxford?
Roshi points.
MASTER ROSHI
It’s that way.
GOKU
Thanks. I’ll see you guys there.
Goku steps on the cloud and WHOOSH TAKES OFF INTO THE
SKY.
BULMA
Hey, he could have given us a ride!
Wonder why he was in such a rush to get
back to Oxford?
Both Roshi and Yamcha look at her like “Don’t you know.”
They mount their horses and head off into the sun.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. THE SKY - DAY
CLOSE ON:
GOKU AND CHI-CHI
125.
They look at each other eyes filled with love. The WIND
WHIPS THEIR HAIR LIKE CRAZY. They KISS then they both
look forward -- to the future maybe?
PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
THEY ARE BOTH RIDING THE FLYING NIMBUS. Goku can’t
contain his joy! He pumps his fist in the air!
GOKU
YAHOOOO!
WHOOSH THEY RIDE RIGHT AT US AND --
POW!
WE’RE OUTTA HERE.
FADE OUT.
